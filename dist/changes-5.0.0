****************************************************************************
*                       Source incompatible changes                        *
****************************************************************************


- QSslCertificate::subjectInfo() and QSslCertificate::issuerInfo() now
  return a QStringList instead of a QString

- QSslCertificate::isValid() has been deprecated. Originally it only checked
  the certificate dates, but later checking for blacklisting was added. Now
  there's a more specific QSslCertificate::isBlacklisted() method.

- Unite clipping support has been removed from QPainter. The alternative is
  to unite QRegion's and using the result on QPainter.

- QLibrary::resolve() now returns a function pointer instead of a void
  pointer.

- QSslCertificate::alternateSubjectNames() is deprecated (but can be enabled
  via QT_DISABLE_DEPRECATED_BEFORE), use
  QSslCertificate::subjectAlternativeNames() instead.

- QLibraryInfo::buildKey() has been removed. Likewise, the QT_BUILD_KEY
  preprocessor #define has also been removed. The build-key is obsolete
  and is no longer necessary.

- QCoreApplication::translate() will no longer return the source text when
  the translation is empty. Use lrelease -removeidentical for optimization.

- Qt::escape() is deprecated (but can be enabled via
  QT_DISABLE_DEPRECATED_BEFORE), use QString::toHtmlEscaped() instead.

- QBool is gone. QString::contains, QByteArray::contains, and QList::contains
  used to return an internal QBool class so that the Qt3 code
  "if (a.contains() == 2)" wouldn't compile anymore. Such code cannot exist
  in Qt4, so these methods return a bool now. If your code used the undocumented
  QBool, simply replace it with bool.

- QMetaType::construct() has been renamed to QMetaType::create().

- QTestLib:
  * The QTRY_VERIFY and QTRY_COMPARE macros have been moved into QTestLib.
    These macros formerly lived in tests/shared/util.h but are now provided
    by including the <QtTest/QtTest> header. In addition,
    QTRY_VERIFY_WITH_TIMEOUT and QTRY_COMPARE_WITH_TIMEOUT are provided,
    allowing for specifying custom timeout values.
  * The QTEST_NOOP_MAIN macro has been removed from the API.  If a test is
    known at compile-time to be inapplicable for a particular build it should
    be omitted via .pro file logic, or the test should call QSKIP in the
    initTestCase() method to skip the entire test and report a meaningful
    explanation in the test log.
  * The DEPENDS_ON macro has been removed from the API.  This macro did nothing
    and misled some users to believe that they could make test functions depend
    on each other or impose an execution order on test functions.
  * The QTest::qt_snprintf function has been removed from the API.  This was an
    internal testlib function that was exposed in the public API due to its use
    in a public macro.  Any calls to this function should be replaced by a call
    to qsnprintf(), which comes from the <QtCore/QByteArray> header.
  * The QTest::pixmapsAreEqual() function has been removed from the API.
    Comparison of QPixmap objects should be done using QCOMPARE, which provides
    more informative output in the event of a failure.
  * The QSKIP macro no longer has the "mode" parameter, which caused problems
    for calculating test metrics, as the SkipAll mode hid information about
    what test data was skipped.  Calling QSKIP in a test function now behaves
    like SkipSingle -- skipping a non-data-driven test function or skipping
    only the current data row of a data-driven test function.  Every skipped
    data row is now reported in the test log.

- The QSsl::TlsV1 enum value was renamed to QSsl::TlsV1_0 .

- QAccessible:
  * Internal QAccessible::State enum value HasInvokeExtension removed
- QAccessibleInterface:
  * The "child" integer parameters have been removed. This moves the api
    to be closer to IAccessible2.
    This means several functions lose their integer parameter:
    text(Text t, int child) -> text(Text t), rect(int child) -> rect()
    setText(Text t, int child, const QString &text) -> setText(Text t, const QString &text)
    role(int child) -> role(), state(int child) -> state()
    relationTo(int child, const QAccessibleInterface *other, int otherChild) ->
      relationTo(const QAccessibleInterface *other)
  * Accessible-Action related functions have been removed. QAccessibleInterface
    subclasses are expected to implement the QAccessibleActionInterface instead.
    These functions have been removed:
    QAccessibleInterface::userActionCount, QAccessibleInterface::actionText,
    QAccessibleInterface::doAction
- QAccessibleEvent also loses the child parameter.
    QAccessibleEvent(Type type, int child) -> QAccessibleEvent(Type type)
    QAccessibleEvent::child() removed.
- QAccessibleActionInterface:
  * Refactored to be based on action names. All functions have been changed from using
    int parameters to strings.

- QSound has been moved from QtGui to QtMultimedia

- QTouchEvent:

  * The DeviceType enum and deviceType() have been deprecated due to
    the introduction of QTouchDevice.

  * The signature of the constructor has changed. It now takes a
    QTouchDevice pointer instead of just a DeviceType value.

  * TouchPointState no longer includes TouchPointStateMask and
    TouchPointPrimary. QTouchEvent::TouchPoint::isPrimary() has
    been removed.

  * QWidget *widget() has been removed and is replaced by QObject
    *target() in order to avoid QWidget dependencies.

- QMetaType

  * It is no longer possible to use Q_DECLARE_METATYPE(Foo*) where Foo is only
    forward declared - it must be fully defined.

- QWindowSystemInterface:

  * The signature of all handleTouchEvent() variants have changed,
    taking a QTouchDevice* instead of just a DeviceType value.
    Platform or generic plug-ins have to create and register at least
    one QTouchDevice before sending the first touch event.

  * The event type parameter is removed from handleTouchEvent().

- The previously exported function qt_translateRawTouchEvent() has been removed.
  Use QWindowSystemInterface::handleTouchEvent() instead.

- QAbstractEventDispatcher

  * The signature for the pure-virtual registerTimer() has changed. Subclasses
  of QAbstractEventDispatcher will need to be updated to reimplement the new
  pure-virtual 'virtual void registerTimer(int timerId, int interval,
  Qt::TimerType timerType, QObject *object) = 0;'

  * QAbstractEventDispatcher::TimerInfo is no longer a QPair<int, int>. It is
  now a struct with 3 members: struct TimerInfo { int timerId; int interval;
  Qt::TimerType timerType; }; Reimplementations of
  QAbstractEventDispatcher::registeredTimers() will need to be updated to pass
  3 arguments to the TimerInfo constructor (instead of 2).

- QUuid

  * Removed implicit conversion operator QUuid::operator QString(), instead
  QUuid::toString() function should be used.

- The QHttp, QHttpHeader, QHttpResponseHeader and QHttpRequestHeader classes have
  been removed, QNetworkAccessManager should be used instead.

- The QFtp class is no longer exported, QNetworkAccessManager should be used
  instead.

- QProcess

  * On Windows, QProcess::ForwardedChannels will not forward the output of GUI
    applications anymore, if they do not create a console.

- QAbstractSocket's connectToHost() and disconnectFromHost() are now virtual and
  connectToHostImplementation() and disconnectFromHostImplementation() don't exist.

- QTcpServer::incomingConnection() now takes a qintptr instead of an int.

- QNetworkConfiguration::bearerName() removed, and bearerTypeName() should be used.

- QDir::convertSeparators() (deprecated since Qt 4.2) has been removed. Use
  QDir::toNativeSeparators() instead.

- qmake
  * several functions and built-in variables were modified to return normalized paths.

- QTextCodecPlugin has been removed since it is no longer used. All text codecs
  are now built into QtCore.

General Improvements
--------------------

- The directory structure of the qtbase unit-tests has been reworked to
  more closely match the directory structure of the code under test.
  Integration tests have been moved to tests/auto/integrationtests.

****************************************************************************

QtCore
------
* drop a bogus QChar::NoCategory enum value; the proper QChar::Other_NotAssigned
  value is returned for an unassigned codepoints now.

* layoutAboutToBeChanged is no longer emitted by QAbstractItemModel::beginMoveRows.
  layoutChanged is no longer emitted by QAbstractItemModel::endMoveRows. Proxy models
  should now also connect to (and disconnect from) the rowsAboutToBeMoved and
  rowsMoved signals.

* The default value of the property QSortFilterProxyModel::dynamicSortFilter was
  changed from false to true.

* The signature of the virtual QAbstractItemView::dataChanged method has changed to
  include the roles which have changed. The signature is consistent with the dataChanged
  signal in the model.

* QFileSystemWatcher is now able to return failure in case of errors whilst
  altering the watchlist in both the singular and QStringList overloads of
  addPath and removePath.

* QString::mid, QString::midRef and QByteArray::mid, if the position passed
  is equal to the length (that is, right after the last character/byte),
  now return an empty QString, QStringRef or QByteArray respectively.
  in Qt 4 they returned a null QString or a null QStringRef.

QtGui
-----
* Accessibility has been refactored. The hierachy of accessible objects is implemented via
  proper parent/child functions instead of using navigate which has been deprecated for this purpose.
  Table and cell interfaces have been added to qaccessible2.h

* Touch events and points have been extended to hold additional
  information like capability flags, point-specific flags, velocity,
  and raw positions.

QtWidgets
---------
* QWidget::setInputContext() and QApplication::setInputContext() are removed.
  Input contexts are now platform specific.

* QInputDialog::getInteger() has been obsoleted. Use QInputDialog::getInt() instead.

QtNetwork
---------
* QHostAddress::isLoopback() API added. Returns true if the address is
  one of the IP loopback addresses.

* QSslCertificate::serialNumber() now always returns the serial number in
  hexadecimal format.

* The openssl network backend now reads the ssl configuration file allowing
  the use of openssl engines.


QtOpenGL
--------

QtScript
--------


QTestLib
--------
* [QTBUG-20615] Autotests can now log test output to multiple destinations
  and log formats simultaneously.

****************************************************************************

- Build System

  * Remove qttest_p4.prf file. From now on we should explicitly enable the
    things from it which we want. Autotest .pro files should stop using
    'load(qttest_p4)' and start using 'CONFIG+=testcase' instead.

- Assistant

****************************************************************************
*                   Important Behavior Changes                             *
****************************************************************************

- QPointer

   * QPointer itself is now deprecated, and the implementation of QPointer
     has been changed to use QWeakPointer. The old guard mechanism has been
     removed. This causes two slight changes in behavior when using
     QPointer:

     * When using QPointer on a QWidget (or a subclass of QWidget), previously
     the QPointer would be cleared by the QWidget destructor. Now, the QPointer
     is cleared by the QObject destructor (since this is when QWeakPointers are
     cleared). Any QPointers tracking a widget will NOT be cleared before the
     QWidget destructor destroys the children for the widget being tracked.

     * When constructing a QSharedPointer to take ownership of an object after a
     QPointer is already tracking the object. Previously, the shared pointer
     construction would not be affected by the QPointer, but now that QPointer
     is implemented using QWeakPoiner, constructing the QSharedPointer will
     cause an abort().


- QMessageBox

     * The static function QMessageBox::question has changed the default argument
     for buttons. Before the default was to have an Ok button. That is changed
     to having a yes and a no button.
