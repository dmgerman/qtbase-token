configure & build system
------------------------

 - The -process/-fully-process/-dont-process configure options have been
   removed due to being unnecessary and counterproductive.
 - [QTBUG-36955] The -vcproj configure option was removed. Use "qmake -r -tp vc"
   _after_ building Qt in case you want to use Visual Studio to work on Qt.
 - [QTBUG-37961] Qt plugins contain version info again.
 - [QTBUG-39216] Fixed more cases where the Qt build would pick up headers
   from a pre-existing Qt installation.
 - [QTBUG-41267] Fixed parallelized (jom) -debug-and-release builds.

qmake
-----

 - [QTBUG-21910][Unix] Added 'make dist' target for SUBDIRS projects.
 - [QTBUG-32895][iOS] Fixed structure of bundles. They can be signed now.
 - [QTBUG-26782][VS] Fixed handling of TARGET_EXT.
 - [QTBUG-30712][VS] Fixed handling of QMAKE_LIBFLAGS.
 - [QTBUG-30373][VS] Using different RESOURCES in different build variants
   no longer produces invalid vcxproj files.
 - [QTBUG-37520][VS] Made it possible to suppress qmake warnings about
   unknown compiler options. CONFIG+=suppress_vcproj_warnings.
 - [QTBUG-37363][MSVC2012+] embed_manifest_exe is now properly supported.
 - [QTBUG-41504][MSVC2012+] Building DLLs targeting Windows XP is now
   supported. As a side effect, Windows CE makespecs must not add /ENTRY: to
   QMAKE_LFLAGS_CONSOLE any more. The flag is hard-coded in console.prf now.
 - [QTBUG-35318][Xcode] Fixed QMAKE_BUNDLE_DATA's path resolution.
 - [QTBUG-39527] Fixed qtCompile() when used with jom -jN.
