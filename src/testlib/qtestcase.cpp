comment|/*! \macro QVERIFY(condition)     \relates QTest     The QVERIFY() macro checks whether the \a condition is true or not. If it is    true, execution continues. If not, a failure is recorded in the test log    and the test won't be executed further.     \b {Note:} This macro can only be used in a test function that is invoked    by the test framework.

comment|/*! \macro QVERIFY2(condition, message)      \relates QTest      The QVERIFY2() macro behaves exactly like QVERIFY(), except that it outputs     a verbose \a message when \a condition is false. The \a message is a plain     C string.      Example:     \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 1      \sa QVERIFY(), QCOMPARE() */
comment|/*! \macro QCOMPARE(actual, expected)     \relates QTest     The QCOMPARE macro compares an \a actual value to an \a expected value using    the equals operator. If \a actual and \a expected are identical, execution    continues. If not, a failure is recorded in the test log and the test    won't be executed further.     In the case of comparing floats and doubles, qFuzzyCompare() is used for    comparing. This means that comparing to 0 will likely fail. One solution    to this is to compare to 1, and add 1 to the produced output.     QCOMPARE tries to output the contents of the values if the comparison fails,    so it is visible from the test log why the comparison failed.     QCOMPARE is very strict on the data types. Both \a actual and \a expected    have to be of the same type, otherwise the test won't compile. This prohibits    unspecified behavior from being introduced; that is behavior that usually    occurs when the compiler implicitly casts the argument.     For your own classes, you can use \l QTest::toString() to format values for    outputting into the test log.     \note This macro can only be used in a test function that is invoked    by the test framework.     Example:    \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 2     \sa QVERIFY(), QTRY_COMPARE(), QTest::toString() */

Between each evaluation, events will be processed.

comment|/*! \macro QFETCH(type, name)     \relates QTest     The fetch macro creates a local variable named \a name with the type \a type    on the stack. \a name has to match the element name from the test's data.    If no such element exists, the test will assert.     Assuming a test has the following data:     \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 3     The test data has two elements, a QString called \c aString and an integer    called \c expected. To fetch these values in the actual test:     \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 4     \c aString and \c expected are variables on the stack that are initialized with    the current test data.     \b {Note:} This macro can only be used in a test function that is invoked    by the test framework.

comment|/*! \macro QTEST(actual, testElement)     \relates QTest     QTEST() is a convenience macro for \l QCOMPARE() that compares    the value \a actual with the element \a testElement from the test's data.    If there is no such element, the test asserts.     Apart from that, QTEST() behaves exactly as \l QCOMPARE().

comment|/*! \macro QSKIP(description)     \relates QTest     If called from a test function, the QSKIP() macro stops execution of the test    without adding a failure to the test log. You can use it to skip tests that    wouldn't make sense in the current configuration. The text \a description is    appended to the test log and should contain an explanation of why the test    couldn't be executed.     If the test is data-driven, each call to QSKIP() will skip only the current    row of test data, so an unconditional call to QSKIP will produce one skip    message in the test log for each row of test data.     If called from an _data function, the QSKIP() macro will stop execution of    the _data function and will prevent execution of the associated test    function.     If called from initTestCase() or initTestCase_data(), the QSKIP() macro will    skip all test and _data functions.     \b {Note:} This macro can only be used in a test function or _data    function that is invoked by the test framework.     Example:    \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 8 */
comment|/*! \macro QEXPECT_FAIL(dataIndex, comment, mode)     \relates QTest     The QEXPECT_FAIL() macro marks the next \l QCOMPARE() or \l QVERIFY() as an    expected failure. Instead of adding a failure to the test log, an expected    failure will be reported.     If a \l QVERIFY() or \l QCOMPARE() is marked as an expected failure,    but passes instead, an unexpected pass (XPASS) is written to the test log.     The parameter \a dataIndex describes for which entry in the test data the    failure is expected. Pass an empty string (\c{""}) if the failure    is expected for all entries or if no test data exists.     \a comment will be appended to the test log for the expected failure.     \a mode is a \l QTest::TestFailMode and sets whether the test should    continue to execute or not.     \b {Note:} This macro can only be used in a test function that is invoked    by the test framework.     Example 1:    \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 9     In the example above, an expected fail will be written into the test output    if the variable \c i is not 42. If the variable \c i is 42, an unexpected pass    is written instead. The QEXPECT_FAIL() has no influence on the second QCOMPARE()    statement in the example.     Example 2:    \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 10     The above testfunction will not continue executing for the test data    entry \c{data27}.     \sa QTest::TestFailMode, QVERIFY(), QCOMPARE() */
comment|/*! \macro QFINDTESTDATA(filename)    \since 5.0     \relates QTest     Returns a QString for the testdata file referred to by \a filename, or an    empty QString if the testdata file could not be found.     This macro allows the test to load data from an external file without    hardcoding an absolute filename into the test, or using relative paths    which may be error prone.     The returned path will be the first path from the following list which    resolves to an existing file or directory:     \list    \li \a filename relative to QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath()       (only if a QCoreApplication or QApplication object has been created).    \li \a filename relative to the test's standard install directory       (QLibraryInfo::TestsPath with the lowercased testcase name appended).    \li \a filename relative to the directory containing the source file from which       QFINDTESTDATA is invoked.    \endlist     If the named file/directory does not exist at any of these locations,    a warning is printed to the test log.     For example, in this code:    \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 26     The testdata file will be resolved as the first existing file from:     \list    \li \c{/home/user/build/myxmlparser/tests/tst_myxmlparser/testxml/simple1.xml}    \li \c{/usr/local/Qt-5.0.0/tests/tst_myxmlparser/testxml/simple1.xml}    \li \c{/home/user/sources/myxmlparser/tests/tst_myxmlparser/testxml/simple1.xml}    \endlist     This allows the test to find its testdata regardless of whether the    test has been installed, and regardless of whether the test's build tree    is equal to the test's source tree.     \b {Note:} reliable detection of testdata from the source directory requires    either that qmake is used, or the \c{QT_TESTCASE_BUILDDIR} macro is defined to    point to the working directory from which the compiler is invoked, or only    absolute paths to the source files are passed to the compiler. Otherwise, the    absolute path of the source directory cannot be determined.     \b {Note:} For tests that use the \l QTEST_APPLESS_MAIN() macro to generate a    \c{main()} function, \c{QFINDTESTDATA} will not attempt to find test data    relative to QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath().  In practice, this means that    tests using \c{QTEST_APPLESS_MAIN()} will fail to find their test data    if run from a shadow build tree. */
comment|/*! \macro QTEST_MAIN(TestClass)      \relates QTest      Implements a main() function that instantiates an application object and     the \a TestClass, and executes all tests in the order they were defined.     Use this macro to build stand-alone executables.      If \c QT_WIDGETS_LIB is defined, the application object will be a QApplication,     if \c QT_GUI_LIB is defined, the application object will be a QGuiApplication,     otherwise it will be a QCoreApplication.  If qmake is used and the configuration     includes \c{QT += widgets}, then \c QT_WIDGETS_LIB will be defined automatically.     Similarly, if qmake is used and the configuration includes \c{QT += gui}, then     \c QT_GUI_LIB will be defined automatically.      \b {Note:} On platforms that have keypad navigation enabled by default,     this macro will forcefully disable it if \c QT_WIDGETS_LIB is defined.  This is done     to simplify the usage of key events when writing autotests. If you wish to write a     test case that uses keypad navigation, you should enable it either in the     \c {initTestCase()} or \c {init()} functions of your test case by calling     \l {QApplication::setNavigationMode()}.      Example:     \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 11      \sa QTEST_APPLESS_MAIN(), QTEST_GUILESS_MAIN(), QTest::qExec(),     QApplication::setNavigationMode() */

comment|/*!     Executes tests declared in \a testObject. In addition, the private slots     \c{initTestCase()}, \c{cleanupTestCase()}, \c{init()} and \c{cleanup()}     are executed if they exist. See \l{Creating a Test} for more details.      Optionally, the command line arguments \a argc and \a argv can be provided.     For a list of recognized arguments, read \l {QTestLib Command Line Arguments}.      The following example will run all tests in \c MyTestObject:      \snippet code/src_qtestlib_qtestcase.cpp 18      This function returns 0 if no tests failed, or a value other than 0 if one     or more tests failed or in case of unhandled exceptions.  (Skipped tests do     not influence the return value.)      For stand-alone test applications, the convenience macro \l QTEST_MAIN() can     be used to declare a main() function that parses the command line arguments     and executes the tests, avoiding the need to call this function explicitly.      The return value from this function is also the exit code of the test     application when the \l QTEST_MAIN() macro is used.      For stand-alone test applications, this function should not be called more     than once, as command-line options for logging test output to files and     executing individual test functions will not behave correctly.      Note: This function is not reentrant, only one test can run at a time. A     test that was executed with qExec() can't run another test via qExec() and     threads are not allowed to call qExec() simultaneously.      If you have programatically created the arguments, as opposed to getting them     from the arguments in \c main(), it is likely of interest to use     QTest::qExec(QObject *, const QStringList&) since it is Unicode safe.      \sa QTEST_MAIN() */
