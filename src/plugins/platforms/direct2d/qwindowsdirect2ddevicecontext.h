comment|/*  * Convenience class for handling device contexts. We have to call BeginDraw  * before anything can happen, and EndDraw once we're done, for every frame and  * pretty much any kind of operation.  *  * Unfortunately, these calls cannot be interleaved, and there is no way to check  * what state a device context is in.  *  * The end result is that the following throws an error if we don't track it:  *      QPixmap pmap;  *      QPainter painter(&pmap);  *      pmap.clear();  *  * Here BeginDraw would first be called through the paint device, then when we clear  * the pixmap we would have to call it again. There is no way to know what state  * the device context is in when performing the clear, and activating the dc is an  * error. Bummer.  *  * Hence we keep a reference count here and only activate/deactivate the device  * if the refcount is zero.  *  * In a nutshell: Do not call BeginDraw/EndDraw yourself on the device pointer, do  * so through the begin/end members below.  */
