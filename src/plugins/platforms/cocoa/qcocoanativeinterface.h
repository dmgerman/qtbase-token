comment|/*         "Virtual" function to create the platform printer support         implementation.          We use an invokable function instead of a virtual one, we do not want         this in the QPlatform* API yet.          This was added here only because QPlatformNativeInterface is a QObject         and allow us to use QMetaObject::indexOfMethod() from the printsupport         plugin.     */
