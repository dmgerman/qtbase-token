comment|/*! \class QFutureSynchronizer     \since 4.4      \brief The QFutureSynchronizer class is a convenience class that simplifies     QFuture synchronization.      \ingroup thread      QFutureSynchronizer is a template class that simplifies synchronization of     one or more QFuture objects. Futures are added using the addFuture() or     setFuture() functions. The futures() function returns a list of futures.     Use clearFutures() to remove all futures from the QFutureSynchronizer.          The waitForFinished() function waits for all futures to finish.     The destructor of QFutureSynchronizer calls waitForFinished(), providing     an easy way to ensure that all futures have finished before returning from     a function:          \snippet code/src_concurrent_qfuturesynchronizer.cpp 0          The behavior of waitForFinished() can be changed using the     setCancelOnWait() function. Calling setCancelOnWait(true) will cause     waitForFinished() to cancel all futures before waiting for them to finish.     You can query the status of the cancel-on-wait feature using the     cancelOnWait() function.          \sa QFuture, QFutureWatcher, {Concurrent Programming}{Qt Concurrent} */
