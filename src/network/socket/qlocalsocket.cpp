comment|/*!     \class QLocalSocket     \since 4.4     \inmodule QtNetwork      \brief The QLocalSocket class provides a local socket.      On Windows this is a named pipe and on Unix this is a local domain socket.      If an error occurs, socketError() returns the type of error, and     errorString() can be called to get a human readable description     of what happened.      Although QLocalSocket is designed for use with an event loop, it's possible     to use it without one. In that case, you must use waitForConnected(),     waitForReadyRead(), waitForBytesWritten(), and waitForDisconnected()     which blocks until the operation is complete or the timeout expires.      Note that this feature is not supported on versions of Windows earlier than     Windows XP.      \sa QLocalServer */

comment|/*!     \fn void QLocalSocket::open(OpenMode openMode)      Equivalent to connectToServer(OpenMode mode).     The socket is opened in the given \a openMode to the server defined by setServerName().      Note that unlike in most other QIODevice subclasses, open() may not open the device directly.     The function return false if the socket was already connected or if the server to connect     to was not defined and true in any other case. The connected() or error() signals will be     emitted once the device is actualy open (or the connection failed).      See connectToServer() for more details. */

If any data was written, this function     returns true; otherwise false is returned.      Call this function if you need QLocalSocket to start sending buffered data     immediately. The number of bytes successfully written depends on the     operating system. In most cases, you do not need to call this function,     because QLocalSocket will start sending data automatically once control     goes back to the event loop. In the absence of an event loop, call     waitForBytesWritten() instead.      \sa write(), waitForBytesWritten() */

Exceptionally, a buffer size of 0     means that the read buffer is unlimited and all incoming data is buffered.     This is the default.      This option is useful if you only read the data at certain points in     time (e.g., in a real-time streaming application) or if you want to     protect your socket against receiving too much data, which may eventually     cause your application to run out of memory.      \sa readBufferSize(), read() */
