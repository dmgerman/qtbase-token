comment|/*!     \class QAbstractSocket      \brief The QAbstractSocket class provides the base functionality     common to all socket types.      \reentrant     \ingroup network     \inmodule QtNetwork      QAbstractSocket is the base class for QTcpSocket and QUdpSocket     and contains all common functionality of these two classes. If     you need a socket, you have two options:      \list     \li  Instantiate QTcpSocket or QUdpSocket.     \li  Create a native socket descriptor, instantiate         QAbstractSocket, and call setSocketDescriptor() to wrap the         native socket.     \endlist      TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a reliable,     stream-oriented, connection-oriented transport protocol. UDP     (User Datagram Protocol) is an unreliable, datagram-oriented,     connectionless protocol. In practice, this means that TCP is     better suited for continuous transmission of data, whereas the     more lightweight UDP can be used when reliability isn't     important.      QAbstractSocket's API unifies most of the differences between the     two protocols. For example, although UDP is connectionless,     connectToHost() establishes a virtual connection for UDP sockets,     enabling you to use QAbstractSocket in more or less the same way     regardless of the underlying protocol. Internally,     QAbstractSocket remembers the address and port passed to     connectToHost(), and functions like read() and write() use these     values.      At any time, QAbstractSocket has a state (returned by     state()). The initial state is UnconnectedState. After     calling connectToHost(), the socket first enters     HostLookupState. If the host is found, QAbstractSocket enters     ConnectingState and emits the hostFound() signal. When the     connection has been established, it enters ConnectedState and     emits connected(). If an error occurs at any stage, error() is     emitted. Whenever the state changes, stateChanged() is emitted.     For convenience, isValid() returns true if the socket is ready for     reading and writing, but note that the socket's state must be     ConnectedState before reading and writing can occur.      Read or write data by calling read() or write(), or use the     convenience functions readLine() and readAll(). QAbstractSocket     also inherits getChar(), putChar(), and ungetChar() from     QIODevice, which work on single bytes. The bytesWritten() signal     is emitted when data has been written to the socket. Note that Qt does     not limit the write buffer size. You can monitor its size by listening     to this signal.      The readyRead() signal is emitted every time a new chunk of data     has arrived. bytesAvailable() then returns the number of bytes     that are available for reading. Typically, you would connect the     readyRead() signal to a slot and read all available data there.     If you don't read all the data at once, the remaining data will     still be available later, and any new incoming data will be     appended to QAbstractSocket's internal read buffer. To limit the     size of the read buffer, call setReadBufferSize().      To close the socket, call disconnectFromHost(). QAbstractSocket enters     QAbstractSocket::ClosingState. After all pending data has been written to     the socket, QAbstractSocket actually closes the socket, enters     QAbstractSocket::ClosedState, and emits disconnected(). If you want to     abort a connection immediately, discarding all pending data, call abort()     instead. If the remote host closes the connection, QAbstractSocket will     emit error(QAbstractSocket::RemoteHostClosedError), during which the socket     state will still be ConnectedState, and then the disconnected() signal     will be emitted.      The port and address of the connected peer is fetched by calling     peerPort() and peerAddress(). peerName() returns the host name of     the peer, as passed to connectToHost(). localPort() and     localAddress() return the port and address of the local socket.      QAbstractSocket provides a set of functions that suspend the     calling thread until certain signals are emitted. These functions     can be used to implement blocking sockets:      \list     \li waitForConnected() blocks until a connection has been established.      \li waitForReadyRead() blocks until new data is available for     reading.      \li waitForBytesWritten() blocks until one payload of data has been     written to the socket.      \li waitForDisconnected() blocks until the connection has closed.     \endlist      We show an example:      \snippet network/tcpwait.cpp 0      If \l{QIODevice::}{waitForReadyRead()} returns false, the     connection has been closed or an error has occurred.      Programming with a blocking socket is radically different from     programming with a non-blocking socket. A blocking socket doesn't     require an event loop and typically leads to simpler code.     However, in a GUI application, blocking sockets should only be     used in non-GUI threads, to avoid freezing the user interface.     See the \l fortuneclient and \l blockingfortuneclient     examples for an overview of both approaches.      \note We discourage the use of the blocking functions together     with signals. One of the two possibilities should be used.      QAbstractSocket can be used with QTextStream and QDataStream's     stream operators (operator<<() and operator>>()). There is one     issue to be aware of, though: You must make sure that enough data     is available before attempting to read it using operator>>().      \sa QNetworkAccessManager, QTcpServer */

comment|/*! \enum QAbstractSocket::BindFlag     \since 5.0      This enum describes the different flags you can pass to modify the     behavior of QAbstractSocket::bind().      \value ShareAddress Allow other services to bind to the same address     and port. This is useful when multiple processes share     the load of a single service by listening to the same address and port     (e.g., a web server with several pre-forked listeners can greatly     improve response time). However, because any service is allowed to     rebind, this option is subject to certain security considerations.     Note that by combining this option with ReuseAddressHint, you will     also allow your service to rebind an existing shared address. On     Unix, this is equivalent to the SO_REUSEADDR socket option. On Windows,     this option is ignored.      \value DontShareAddress Bind the address and port exclusively, so that     no other services are allowed to rebind. By passing this option to     QAbstractSocket::bind(), you are guaranteed that on successs, your service     is the only one that listens to the address and port. No services are     allowed to rebind, even if they pass ReuseAddressHint. This option     provides more security than ShareAddress, but on certain operating     systems, it requires you to run the server with administrator privileges.     On Unix and Mac OS X, not sharing is the default behavior for binding     an address and port, so this option is ignored. On Windows, this     option uses the SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE socket option.      \value ReuseAddressHint Provides a hint to QAbstractSocket that it should try     to rebind the service even if the address and port are already bound by     another socket. On Windows, this is equivalent to the SO_REUSEADDR     socket option. On Unix, this option is ignored.      \value DefaultForPlatform The default option for the current platform.     On Unix and Mac OS X, this is equivalent to (DontShareAddress     + ReuseAddressHint), and on Windows, its equivalent to ShareAddress. */

For UDP sockets, after binding, the signal QUdpSocket::readyRead() is emitted     whenever a UDP datagram arrives on the specified address and port.     Thus, This function is useful to write UDP servers.      For TCP sockets, this function may be used to specify which interface to use     for an outgoing connection, which is useful in case of multiple network     interfaces.      By default, the socket is bound using the DefaultForPlatform BindMode.     If a port is not specified, a random port is chosen.      On success, the functions returns true and the socket enters     BoundState; otherwise it returns false.  */

At any point, the socket can emit error() to signal that an error     occurred.      \a hostName may be an IP address in string form (e.g.,     "43.195.83.32"), or it may be a host name (e.g.,     "example.com").

If any data was written,     this function returns true; otherwise false is returned.      Call this function if you need QAbstractSocket to start sending buffered     data immediately. The number of bytes successfully written depends on the     operating system. In most cases, you do not need to call this function,     because QAbstractSocket will start sending data automatically once control     goes back to the event loop. In the absence of an event loop, call     waitForBytesWritten() instead.      \sa write(), waitForBytesWritten() */

If the buffer size is limited to a certain size, QAbstractSocket     won't buffer more than this size of data. Exceptionally, a buffer     size of 0 means that the read buffer is unlimited and all     incoming data is buffered. This is the default.      This option is useful if you only read the data at certain points     in time (e.g., in a real-time streaming application) or if you     want to protect your socket against receiving too much data,     which may eventually cause your application to run out of memory.      Only QTcpSocket uses QAbstractSocket's internal buffer; QUdpSocket     does not use any buffering at all, but rather relies on the     implicit buffering provided by the operating system.     Because of this, calling this function on QUdpSocket has no     effect.      \sa readBufferSize(), read() */
