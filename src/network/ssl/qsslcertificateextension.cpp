comment|/*!     \class QSslCertificateExtension     \brief The QSslCertificateExtension class provides an API for accessing the     extensions of an X509 certificate.     \since 5.0      \reentrant     \ingroup network     \ingroup ssl     \ingroup shared     \inmodule QtNetwork      QSslCertificateExtension provides access to an extension stored in     an X509 certificate. The information available depends on the type     of extension being accessed.      All X509 certificate extensions have the following properties:      \table     \header        \li Property        \li Description     \row        \li name        \li The human readable name of the extension, eg. 'basicConstraints'.     \row        \li criticality        \li This is a boolean value indicating if the extension is critical           to correctly interpreting the certificate.     \row        \li oid        \li The ASN.1 object identifier that specifies which extension this           is.     \row        \li supported        \li If this is true the structure of the extension's value will not           change between Qt versions.     \row        \li value        \li A QVariant with a structure dependent on the type of extension.     \endtable      Whilst this class provides access to any type of extension, only     some are guaranteed to be returned in a format that will remain     unchanged between releases. The isSupported() method returns true     for extensions where this is the case.      The extensions currently supported, and the structure of the value     returned are as follows:      \table     \header        \li Name        \li OID        \li Details     \row        \li basicConstraints        \li 2.5.29.19        \li Returned as a QVariantMap. The key 'ca' contains a boolean value,           the optional key 'pathLenConstraint' contains an integer.     \row        \li authorityInfoAccess        \li 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.1.1        \li Returned as a QVariantMap. There is a key for each access method,           with the value being a URI.     \row        \li subjectKeyIdentifier        \li 2.5.29.14        \li Returned as a QVariant containing a QString. The string is the key           identifier.     \row        \li authorityKeyIdentifier        \li 2.5.29.35        \li Returned as a QVariantMap. The optional key 'keyid' contains the key           identifier as a hex string stored in a QByteArray. The optional key           'serial' contains the authority key serial number as a qlonglong.           Currently there is no support for the general names field of this           extension.     \endtable      In addition to the supported extensions above, many other common extensions     will be returned in a reasonably structured way. Extensions that the SSL     backend has no support for at all will be returned as a QByteArray.      Further information about the types of extensions certificates can     contain can be found in RFC 5280.      \sa QSslCertificate::extensions()  */
