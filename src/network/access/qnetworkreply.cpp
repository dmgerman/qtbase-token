comment|/*!     \class QNetworkReply     \since 4.4     \brief The QNetworkReply class contains the data and headers for a request     sent with QNetworkAccessManager      \reentrant     \ingroup network     \inmodule QtNetwork      The QNetworkReply class contains the data and meta data related to     a request posted with QNetworkAccessManager. Like QNetworkRequest,     it contains a URL and headers (both in parsed and raw form), some     information about the reply's state and the contents of the reply     itself.      QNetworkReply is a sequential-access QIODevice, which means that     once data is read from the object, it no longer kept by the     device. It is therefore the application's responsibility to keep     this data if it needs to. Whenever more data is received from the     network and processed, the readyRead() signal is emitted.      The downloadProgress() signal is also emitted when data is     received, but the number of bytes contained in it may not     represent the actual bytes received, if any transformation is done     to the contents (for example, decompressing and removing the     protocol overhead).      Even though QNetworkReply is a QIODevice connected to the contents     of the reply, it also emits the uploadProgress() signal, which     indicates the progress of the upload for operations that have such     content.      \note Do not delete the object in the slot connected to the     error() or finished() signal. Use deleteLater().      \sa QNetworkRequest, QNetworkAccessManager */

comment|/*!     \fn void QNetworkReply::encrypted()     \since 5.1      This signal is emitted when an SSL/TLS session has successfully     completed the initial handshake. At this point, no user data     has been transmitted. The signal can be used to perform     additional checks on the certificate chain, for example to     notify users when the certificate for a website has changed.     If the reply does not match the expected criteria then it should     be aborted by calling QNetworkReply::abort() by a slot connected     to this signal. The SSL configuration in use can be inspected     using the QNetworkReply::sslConfiguration() method.      Internally, QNetworkAccessManager may open multiple connections     to a server, in order to allow it process requests in parallel.     These connections may be reused, which means that the encrypted()     signal would not be emitted. This means that you are only     guaranteed to receive this signal for the first connection to a     site in the lifespan of the QNetworkAccessManager.      \sa QSslSocket::encrypted()     \sa QNetworkAccessManager::encrypted() */

The     \a errors parameter contains the list of errors.      To indicate that the errors are not fatal and that the connection     should proceed, the ignoreSslErrors() function should be called     from the slot connected to this signal. If it is not called, the     SSL session will be torn down before any data is exchanged     (including the URL).      This signal can be used to display an error message to the user     indicating that security may be compromised and display the     SSL settings (see sslConfiguration() to obtain it). If the user     decides to proceed after analyzing the remote certificate, the     slot should call ignoreSslErrors().      \sa QSslSocket::sslErrors(), QNetworkAccessManager::sslErrors(),     sslConfiguration(), ignoreSslErrors() */

After this signal is emitted, there will be no more     updates to the reply's data or metadata.      Unless close() has been called, the reply will be still be opened     for reading, so the data can be retrieved by calls to read() or     readAll(). In particular, if no calls to read() were made as a     result of readyRead(), a call to readAll() will retrieve the full     contents in a QByteArray.      This signal is emitted in tandem with     QNetworkAccessManager::finished() where that signal's reply     parameter is this object.      \note Do not delete the object in the slot connected to this     signal.

If this function is called, SSL errors related to network     connection will be ignored, including certificate validation     errors.      \warning Be sure to always let the user inspect the errors     reported by the sslErrors() signal, and only call this method     upon confirmation from the user that proceeding is ok.     If there are unexpected errors, the reply should be aborted.     Calling this method without inspecting the actual errors will     most likely pose a security risk for your application. Use it     with great care!      This function can be called from the slot connected to the     sslErrors() signal, which indicates which errors were     found.      \sa sslConfiguration(), sslErrors(), QSslSocket::ignoreSslErrors() */
