comment|/*!     \class QNetworkConfiguration      \brief The QNetworkConfiguration class provides an abstraction of one or more access point configurations.      \since 4.7      \inmodule QtNetwork     \ingroup network     \ingroup shared      QNetworkConfiguration encapsulates a single access point or service network.     In most cases a single access point configuration can be mapped to one network     interface. However a single network interface may not always map to only one     access point configuration. Multiple configurations for the same     network device may enable multiple access points. An example     device that could exhibit such a configuration might be a     Smartphone which allows the user to manage multiple WLAN     configurations while the device itself has only one WLAN network device.      The QNetworkConfiguration also supports the concept of service networks.     This concept allows the grouping of multiple access point configurations     into one entity. Such a group is called service network and can be     beneficial in cases whereby a network session to a     particular destination network is required (e.g. a company network).     When using a service network the user doesn't usually care which one of the     connectivity options is chosen (e.g. corporate WLAN or VPN via GPRS)     as long as he can reach the company's target server. Depending     on the current position and time some of the access points that make     up the service network may not even be available. Furthermore     automated access point roaming can be enabled which enables the device     to change the network interface configuration dynamically while maintaining     the applications connection to the target network. It allows adaption     to the changing environment and may enable optimization with regards to     cost, speed or other network parameters.      Special configurations of type UserChoice provide a placeholder configuration which is     resolved to an actual network configuration by the platform when a     \l {QNetworkSession}{session} is \l {QNetworkSession::open()}{opened}. Not all platforms     support the concept of a user choice configuration.      \section1 Configuration states      The list of available configurations can be obtained via     QNetworkConfigurationManager::allConfigurations(). A configuration can have     multiple states. The \l Defined configuration state indicates that the configuration     is stored on the device. However the configuration is not yet ready to be activated     as e.g. a WLAN may not be available at the current time.      The \l Discovered state implies that the configuration is \l Defined and     the outside conditions are such that the configuration can be used immediately     to open a new network session. An example of such an outside condition may be     that the Ethernet cable is actually connected to the device or that the WLAN     with the specified SSID is in range.      The \l Active state implies that the configuration is \l Discovered. A configuration     in this state is currently being used by an application. The underlying network     interface has a valid IP configuration and can transfer IP packets between the     device and the target network.      The \l Undefined state indicates that the system has knowledge of possible target     networks but cannot actually use that knowledge to connect to it. An example     for such a state could be an encrypted WLAN that has been discovered     but the user hasn't actually saved a configuration including the required password     which would allow the device to connect to it.      Depending on the type of configuration some states are transient in nature. A GPRS/UMTS     connection may almost always be \l Discovered if the GSM/UMTS network is available.     However if the GSM/UMTS network looses the connection the associated configuration may change its state     from \l Discovered to \l Defined as well. A similar use case might be triggered by     WLAN availability. QNetworkConfigurationManager::updateConfigurations() can be used to     manually trigger updates of states. Note that some platforms do not require such updates     as they implicitly change the state once it has been discovered. If the state of a     configuration changes all related QNetworkConfiguration instances change their state automatically.      \sa QNetworkSession, QNetworkConfigurationManager */

comment|/*!     \enum QNetworkConfiguration::Type      This enum describes the type of configuration.      \value InternetAccessPoint  The configuration specifies the details for a single access point.                                 Note that configurations of type InternetAccessPoint may be part                                 of other QNetworkConfigurations of type ServiceNetwork.     \value ServiceNetwork       The configuration is based on a group of QNetworkConfigurations of                                 type InternetAccessPoint. All group members can reach the same                                 target network. This type of configuration is a mandatory                                 requirement for roaming enabled network sessions. On some                                 platforms this form of configuration may also be called Service                                 Network Access Point (SNAP).     \value UserChoice           The configuration is a placeholder which will be resolved to an                                 actual configuration by the platform when a session is opened. Depending                                 on the platform the selection may generate a popup dialog asking the user                                 for his preferred choice.     \value Invalid              The configuration is invalid. */

comment|/*!     \enum QNetworkConfiguration::StateFlag      Specifies the configuration states.      \value Undefined    This state is used for transient configurations such as newly discovered                         WLANs for which the user has not actually created a configuration yet.     \value Defined      Defined configurations are known to the system but are not immediately                         usable (e.g. a configured WLAN is not within range or the Ethernet cable                         is currently not plugged into the machine).     \value Discovered   A discovered configuration can be immediately used to create a new                         QNetworkSession. An example of a discovered configuration could be a WLAN                         which is within in range. If the device moves out of range the discovered                         flag is dropped. A second example is a GPRS configuration which generally                         remains discovered for as long as the device has network coverage. A                         configuration that has this state is also in state                         QNetworkConfiguration::Defined. If the configuration is a service network                         this flag is set if at least one of the underlying access points                         configurations has the Discovered state.     \value Active       The configuration is currently used by an open network session                         (see \l QNetworkSession::isOpen()). However this does not mean that the                         current process is the entity that created the open session. It merely                         indicates that if a new QNetworkSession were to be constructed based on                         this configuration \l QNetworkSession::state() would return                         \l QNetworkSession::Connected. This state implies the                         QNetworkConfiguration::Discovered state. */
