comment|/*!   \class QXmlStreamReader   \inmodule QtCore   \reentrant   \since 4.3    \brief The QXmlStreamReader class provides a fast parser for reading   well-formed XML via a simple streaming API.     \ingroup xml-tools    QXmlStreamReader is a faster and more convenient replacement for   Qt's own SAX parser (see QXmlSimpleReader). In some cases it might   also be a faster and more convenient alternative for use in   applications that would otherwise use a DOM tree (see QDomDocument).   QXmlStreamReader reads data either from a QIODevice (see   setDevice()), or from a raw QByteArray (see addData()).    Qt provides QXmlStreamWriter for writing XML.    The basic concept of a stream reader is to report an XML document as   a stream of tokens, similar to SAX. The main difference between   QXmlStreamReader and SAX is \e how these XML tokens are reported.   With SAX, the application must provide handlers (callback functions)   that receive so-called XML \e events from the parser at the parser's   convenience.  With QXmlStreamReader, the application code itself   drives the loop and pulls \e tokens from the reader, one after   another, as it needs them. This is done by calling readNext(), where   the reader reads from the input stream until it completes the next   token, at which point it returns the tokenType(). A set of   convenient functions including isStartElement() and text() can then   be used to examine the token to obtain information about what has   been read. The big advantage of this \e pulling approach is the   possibility to build recursive descent parsers with it, meaning you   can split your XML parsing code easily into different methods or   classes. This makes it easy to keep track of the application's own   state when parsing XML.    A typical loop with QXmlStreamReader looks like this:    \snippet code/src_corelib_xml_qxmlstream.cpp 0     QXmlStreamReader is a well-formed XML 1.0 parser that does \e not   include external parsed entities. As long as no error occurs, the   application code can thus be assured that the data provided by the   stream reader satisfies the W3C's criteria for well-formed XML. For   example, you can be certain that all tags are indeed nested and   closed properly, that references to internal entities have been   replaced with the correct replacement text, and that attributes have   been normalized or added according to the internal subset of the   DTD.    If an error occurs while parsing, atEnd() and hasError() return   true, and error() returns the error that occurred. The functions   errorString(), lineNumber(), columnNumber(), and characterOffset()   are for constructing an appropriate error or warning message. To   simplify application code, QXmlStreamReader contains a raiseError()   mechanism that lets you raise custom errors that trigger the same   error handling described.    The \l{QXmlStream Bookmarks Example} illustrates how to use the   recursive descent technique to read an XML bookmark file (XBEL) with   a stream reader.    \section1 Namespaces    QXmlStream understands and resolves XML namespaces. E.g. in case of   a StartElement, namespaceUri() returns the namespace the element is   in, and name() returns the element's \e local name. The combination   of namespaceUri and name uniquely identifies an element. If a   namespace prefix was not declared in the XML entities parsed by the   reader, the namespaceUri is empty.    If you parse XML data that does not utilize namespaces according to   the XML specification or doesn't use namespaces at all, you can use   the element's qualifiedName() instead. A qualified name is the   element's prefix() followed by colon followed by the element's local   name() - exactly like the element appears in the raw XML data. Since   the mapping namespaceUri to prefix is neither unique nor universal,   qualifiedName() should be avoided for namespace-compliant XML data.    In order to parse standalone documents that do use undeclared   namespace prefixes, you can turn off namespace processing completely   with the \l namespaceProcessing property.    \section1 Incremental parsing    QXmlStreamReader is an incremental parser. It can handle the case   where the document can't be parsed all at once because it arrives in   chunks (e.g. from multiple files, or over a network connection).   When the reader runs out of data before the complete document has   been parsed, it reports a PrematureEndOfDocumentError. When more   data arrives, either because of a call to addData() or because more   data is available through the network device(), the reader recovers   from the PrematureEndOfDocumentError error and continues parsing the   new data with the next call to readNext().    For example, if your application reads data from the network using a   \l{QNetworkAccessManager} {network access manager}, you would issue   a \l{QNetworkRequest} {network request} to the manager and receive a   \l{QNetworkReply} {network reply} in return. Since a QNetworkReply   is a QIODevice, you connect its \l{QNetworkReply::readyRead()}   {readyRead()} signal to a custom slot, e.g. \c{slotReadyRead()} in   the code snippet shown in the discussion for QNetworkAccessManager.   In this slot, you read all available data with   \l{QNetworkReply::readAll()} {readAll()} and pass it to the XML   stream reader using addData(). Then you call your custom parsing   function that reads the XML events from the reader.    \section1 Performance and memory consumption    QXmlStreamReader is memory-conservative by design, since it doesn't   store the entire XML document tree in memory, but only the current   token at the time it is reported. In addition, QXmlStreamReader   avoids the many small string allocations that it normally takes to   map an XML document to a convenient and Qt-ish API. It does this by   reporting all string data as QStringRef rather than real QString   objects. QStringRef is a thin wrapper around QString substrings that   provides a subset of the QString API without the memory allocation   and reference-counting overhead. Calling   \l{QStringRef::toString()}{toString()} on any of those objects   returns an equivalent real QString object.  */

When atEnd() and hasError() return true and error() returns     PrematureEndOfDocumentError, it means the XML has been well-formed     so far, but a complete XML document has not been parsed. The next     chunk of XML can be added with addData(), if the XML is being read     from a QByteArray, or by waiting for more data to arrive if the     XML is being read from a QIODevice. Either way, atEnd() will     return false once more data is available.      \sa hasError(), error(), device(), QIODevice::atEnd()  */

Then atEnd()   returns true, hasError() returns true, and this function returns   QXmlStreamReader::Invalid.    The exception is when error() returns PrematureEndOfDocumentError.   This error is reported when the end of an otherwise well-formed   chunk of XML is reached, but the chunk doesn't represent a complete   XML document.  In that case, parsing \e can be resumed by calling   addData() to add the next chunk of XML, when the stream is being   read from a QByteArray, or by waiting for more data to arrive when   the stream is being read from a device().    \sa tokenType(), tokenString()  */

The function concatenates text() when it reads either \l Characters   or EntityReference tokens, but skips ProcessingInstruction and \l   Comment. If the current token is not StartElement, an empty string is   returned.    The \a behaviour defines what happens in case anything else is   read before reaching EndElement. The function can include the text from   child elements (useful for example for HTML), ignore child elements, or   raise an UnexpectedElementError and return what was read so far (default).    \since 4.6  */

comment|/*!   \class QXmlStreamWriter   \inmodule QtCore   \since 4.3   \reentrant    \brief The QXmlStreamWriter class provides an XML writer with a   simple streaming API.    \ingroup xml-tools    QXmlStreamWriter is the counterpart to QXmlStreamReader for writing   XML. Like its related class, it operates on a QIODevice specified   with setDevice(). The API is simple and straightforward: for every   XML token or event you want to write, the writer provides a   specialized function.    You start a document with writeStartDocument() and end it with   writeEndDocument(). This will implicitly close all remaining open   tags.    Element tags are opened with writeStartElement() followed by   writeAttribute() or writeAttributes(), element content, and then   writeEndElement(). A shorter form writeEmptyElement() can be used   to write empty elements, followed by writeAttributes().    Element content consists of either characters, entity references or   nested elements. It is written with writeCharacters(), which also   takes care of escaping all forbidden characters and character   sequences, writeEntityReference(), or subsequent calls to   writeStartElement(). A convenience method writeTextElement() can be   used for writing terminal elements that contain nothing but text.    The following abridged code snippet shows the basic use of the class   to write formatted XML with indentation:    \snippet qxmlstreamwriter/main.cpp start stream   \dots   \snippet qxmlstreamwriter/main.cpp write element   \dots   \snippet qxmlstreamwriter/main.cpp finish stream    QXmlStreamWriter takes care of prefixing namespaces, all you have to   do is specify the \c namespaceUri when writing elements or   attributes. If you must conform to certain prefixes, you can force   the writer to use them by declaring the namespaces manually with   either writeNamespace() or writeDefaultNamespace(). Alternatively,   you can bypass the stream writer's namespace support and use   overloaded methods that take a qualified name instead. The namespace   \e http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace is implicit and mapped to the   prefix \e xml.    The stream writer can automatically format the generated XML data by   adding line-breaks and indentation to empty sections between   elements, making the XML data more readable for humans and easier to   work with for most source code management systems. The feature can   be turned on with the \l autoFormatting property, and customized   with the \l autoFormattingIndent property.    Other functions are writeCDATA(), writeComment(),   writeProcessingInstruction(), and writeDTD(). Chaining of XML   streams is supported with writeCurrentToken().    By default, QXmlStreamWriter encodes XML in UTF-8. Different   encodings can be enforced using setCodec().    If an error occurs while writing to the underlying device, hasError()   starts returning true and subsequent writes are ignored.    The \l{QXmlStream Bookmarks Example} illustrates how to use a   stream writer to write an XML bookmark file (XBEL) that   was previously read in by a QXmlStreamReader.  */
