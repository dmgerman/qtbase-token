comment|/*!     \class QFlags     \inmodule QtCore     \brief The QFlags class provides a type-safe way of storing     OR-combinations of enum values.       \ingroup tools      The QFlags<Enum> class is a template class, where Enum is an enum     type. QFlags is used throughout Qt for storing combinations of     enum values.      The traditional C++ approach for storing OR-combinations of enum     values is to use an \c int or \c uint variable. The inconvenience     with this approach is that there's no type checking at all; any     enum value can be OR'd with any other enum value and passed on to     a function that takes an \c int or \c uint.      Qt uses QFlags to provide type safety. For example, the     Qt::Alignment type is simply a typedef for     QFlags<Qt::AlignmentFlag>. QLabel::setAlignment() takes a     Qt::Alignment parameter, which means that any combination of     Qt::AlignmentFlag values, or 0, is legal:      \snippet code/src_corelib_global_qglobal.cpp 0      If you try to pass a value from another enum or just a plain     integer other than 0, the compiler will report an error. If you     need to cast integer values to flags in a untyped fashion, you can     use the explicit QFlags constructor as cast operator.      If you want to use QFlags for your own enum types, use     the Q_DECLARE_FLAGS() and Q_DECLARE_OPERATORS_FOR_FLAGS().      Example:      \snippet code/src_corelib_global_qglobal.cpp 1      You can then use the \c MyClass::Options type to store     combinations of \c MyClass::Option values.      \section1 Flags and the Meta-Object System      The Q_DECLARE_FLAGS() macro does not expose the flags to the meta-object     system, so they cannot be used by Qt Script or edited in Qt Designer.     To make the flags available for these purposes, the Q_FLAGS() macro must     be used:      \snippet code/src_corelib_global_qglobal.cpp meta-object flags      \section1 Naming Convention      A sensible naming convention for enum types and associated QFlags     types is to give a singular name to the enum type (e.g., \c     Option) and a plural name to the QFlags type (e.g., \c Options).     When a singular name is desired for the QFlags type (e.g., \c     Alignment), you can use \c Flag as the suffix for the enum type     (e.g., \c AlignmentFlag).      \sa QFlag */

comment|/*!   \macro Q_DISABLE_COPY(Class)   \relates QObject    Disables the use of copy constructors and assignment operators   for the given \a Class.    Instances of subclasses of QObject should not be thought of as   values that can be copied or assigned, but as unique identities.   This means that when you create your own subclass of QObject   (director or indirect), you should \e not give it a copy constructor   or an assignment operator.  However, it may not enough to simply   omit them from your class, because, if you mistakenly write some code   that requires a copy constructor or an assignment operator (it's easy   to do), your compiler will thoughtfully create it for you. You must   do more.    The curious user will have seen that the Qt classes derived   from QObject typically include this macro in a private section:    \snippet code/src_corelib_global_qglobal.cpp 43    It declares a copy constructor and an assignment operator in the   private section, so that if you use them by mistake, the compiler   will report an error.    \snippet code/src_corelib_global_qglobal.cpp 44    But even this might not catch absolutely every case. You might be   tempted to do something like this:    \snippet code/src_corelib_global_qglobal.cpp 45    First of all, don't do that. Most compilers will generate code that   uses the copy constructor, so the privacy violation error will be   reported, but your C++ compiler is not required to generate code for   this statement in a specific way. It could generate code using   \e{neither} the copy constructor \e{nor} the assignment operator we   made private. In that case, no error would be reported, but your   application would probably crash when you called a member function   of \c{w}. */

comment|/*!     \headerfile<QtGlobal>     \title Global Qt Declarations     \ingroup funclists      \brief The<QtGlobal> header file includes the fundamental global     declarations. It is included by most other Qt header files.      The global declarations include \l{types}, \l{functions} and     \l{macros}.      The type definitions are partly convenience definitions for basic     types (some of which guarantee certain bit-sizes on all platforms     supported by Qt), partly types related to Qt message handling. The     functions are related to generating messages, Qt version handling     and comparing and adjusting object values. And finally, some of     the declared macros enable programmers to add compiler or platform     specific code to their applications, while others are convenience     macros for larger operations.      \section1 Types      The header file declares several type definitions that guarantee a     specified bit-size on all platforms supported by Qt for various     basic types, for example \l qint8 which is a signed char     guaranteed to be 8-bit on all platforms supported by Qt. The     header file also declares the \l qlonglong type definition for \c     {long long int } (\c __int64 on Windows).      Several convenience type definitions are declared: \l qreal for \c     double, \l uchar for \c unsigned char, \l uint for \c unsigned     int, \l ulong for \c unsigned long and \l ushort for \c unsigned     short.      Finally, the QtMsgType definition identifies the various messages     that can be generated and sent to a Qt message handler;     QtMessageHandler is a type definition for a pointer to a function with     the signature     \c {void myMessageHandler(QtMsgType, const QMessageLogContext&, const char *)}.     QMessageLogContext class contains the line, file, and function the     message was logged at. This information is created by the QMessageLogger     class.      \section1 Functions      The<QtGlobal> header file contains several functions comparing     and adjusting an object's value. These functions take a template     type as argument: You can retrieve the absolute value of an object     using the qAbs() function, and you can bound a given object's     value by given minimum and maximum values using the qBound()     function. You can retrieve the minimum and maximum of two given     objects using qMin() and qMax() respectively. All these functions     return a corresponding template type; the template types can be     replaced by any other type.      Example:      \snippet code/src_corelib_global_qglobal.cpp 3<QtGlobal> also contains functions that generate messages from the     given string argument: qCritical(), qDebug(), qFatal() and     qWarning(). These functions call the message handler with the     given message.      Example:      \snippet code/src_corelib_global_qglobal.cpp 4      The remaining functions are qRound() and qRound64(), which both     accept a \l qreal value as their argument returning the value     rounded up to the nearest integer and 64-bit integer respectively,     the qInstallMessageHandler() function which installs the given     QtMessageHandler, and the qVersion() function which returns the     version number of Qt at run-time as a string.      \section1 Macros      The<QtGlobal> header file provides a range of macros (Q_CC_*)     that are defined if the application is compiled using the     specified platforms. For example, the Q_CC_SUN macro is defined if     the application is compiled using Forte Developer, or Sun Studio     C++.  The header file also declares a range of macros (Q_OS_*)     that are defined for the specified platforms. For example,     Q_OS_X11 which is defined for the X Window System.      The purpose of these macros is to enable programmers to add     compiler or platform specific code to their application.      The remaining macros are convenience macros for larger operations:     The QT_TRANSLATE_NOOP() and QT_TR_NOOP() macros provide the     possibility of marking text for dynamic translation,     i.e. translation without changing the stored source text. The     Q_ASSERT() and Q_ASSERT_X() enables warning messages of various     level of refinement. The Q_FOREACH() and foreach() macros     implement Qt's foreach loop.      The Q_INT64_C() and Q_UINT64_C() macros wrap signed and unsigned     64-bit integer literals in a platform-independent way. The     Q_CHECK_PTR() macro prints a warning containing the source code's     file name and line number, saying that the program ran out of     memory, if the pointer is 0. The qPrintable() macro represent an     easy way of printing text.      Finally, the QT_POINTER_SIZE macro expands to the size of a     pointer in bytes, and the QT_VERSION and QT_VERSION_STR macros     expand to a numeric value or a string, respectively, specifying     Qt's version number, i.e the version the application is compiled     against.      \sa<QtAlgorithms>, QSysInfo */

comment|/*!     \macro void Q_ASSUME(bool expr)     \relates<QtGlobal>     \since 5.0      Causes the compiler to assume that \a expr is true. This macro is useful     for improving code generation, by providing the compiler with hints about     conditions that it would not otherwise know about. However, there is no     guarantee that the compiler will actually use those hints.      This macro could be considered a "lighter" version of \l{Q_ASSERT}. While     Q_ASSERT will abort the program's execution if the condition is false,     Q_ASSUME will tell the compiler not to generate code for those conditions.     Therefore, it is important that the assumptions always hold, otherwise     undefined behaviour may occur.      If \a expr is a constantly false condition, Q_ASSUME will tell the compiler     that the current code execution cannot be reached. That is, Q_ASSUME(false)     is equivalent to Q_UNREACHABLE().      In debug builds the condition is enforced by an assert to facilitate debugging.      \note Q_LIKELY() tells the compiler that the expression is likely, but not     the only possibility. Q_ASSUME tells the compiler that it is the only     possibility.      \sa Q_ASSERT(), Q_UNREACHABLE(), Q_LIKELY() */

comment|/*!     \macro void Q_UNREACHABLE()     \relates<QtGlobal>     \since 5.0      Tells the compiler that the current point cannot be reached by any     execution, so it may optimize any code paths leading here as dead code, as     well as code continuing from here.      This macro is useful to mark impossible conditions. For example, given the     following enum:      \snippet code/src_corelib_global_qglobal.cpp qunreachable-enum      One can write a switch table like so:      \snippet code/src_corelib_global_qglobal.cpp qunreachable-switch      The advantage of inserting Q_UNREACHABLE() at that point is that the     compiler is told not to generate code for a shape variable containing that     value. If the macro is missing, the compiler will still generate the     necessary comparisons for that value. If the case label were removed, some     compilers could produce a warning that some enum values were not checked.      By using this macro in impossible conditions, code coverage may be improved     as dead code paths may be eliminated.      In debug builds the condition is enforced by an assert to facilitate debugging.      \sa Q_ASSERT(), Q_ASSUME(), qFatal() */

comment|/*!     \macro const char* Q_FUNC_INFO()     \relates<QtGlobal>      Expands to a string that describe the function the macro resides in. How this string looks     more specifically is compiler dependent. With GNU GCC it is typically the function signature,     while with other compilers it might be the line and column number.      Q_FUNC_INFO can be conveniently used with qDebug(). For example, this function:      \snippet code/src_corelib_global_qglobal.cpp 22      when instantiated with the integer type, will with the GCC compiler produce:      \tt{const TInputType& myMin(const TInputType&, const TInputType&) [with TInputType = int] was called with value1: 3 value2: 4}      If this macro is used outside a function, the behavior is undefined.  */

As a rule of thumb, \c QT_BEGIN_NAMESPACE should appear in all Qt header     and Qt source files after the last \c{#include} line and before the first     declaration.      If that rule can't be followed because, e.g., \c{#include} lines and     declarations are wildly mixed, place \c QT_BEGIN_NAMESPACE before     the first declaration and wrap the \c{#include} lines in     \c QT_BEGIN_INCLUDE_NAMESPACE and \c QT_END_INCLUDE_NAMESPACE.      When using the \c QT_NAMESPACE feature in user code     (e.g., when building plugins statically linked to Qt) where     the user code is not intended to go into the \c QT_NAMESPACE     namespace, all forward declarations of Qt classes need to     be wrapped in \c QT_BEGIN_NAMESPACE and \c QT_END_NAMESPACE.     After that, a \c QT_USE_NAMESPACE should follow.     No further changes should be needed.      \sa QT_NAMESPACE */

comment|/*!     \macro QT_TERMINATE_ON_EXCEPTION(expr)     \relates<QtGlobal>     \internal      In general, use of the Q_DECL_NOEXCEPT macro is preferred over     Q_DECL_NOTHROW, because it exhibits well-defined behavior and     supports the more powerful Q_DECL_NOEXCEPT_EXPR variant. However,     use of Q_DECL_NOTHROW has the advantage that Windows builds     benefit on a wide range or compiler versions that do not yet     support the C++11 noexcept feature.      It may therefore be beneficial to use Q_DECL_NOTHROW and emulate     the C++11 behavior manually with an embedded try/catch.      Qt provides the QT_TERMINATE_ON_EXCEPTION(expr) macro for this     purpose. It either expands to \c expr (if Qt is compiled without     exception support or the compiler supports C++11 noexcept     semantics) or to     \code     try { expr; } catch(...) { qTerminate(); }     \endcode     otherwise.      Since this macro expands to just \c expr if the compiler supports     C++11 noexcept, expecting the compiler to take over responsibility     of calling std::terminate() in that case, it should not be used     outside Q_DECL_NOTHROW functions.      \sa Q_DECL_NOEXCEPT, Q_DECL_NOTHROW, qTerminate() */
