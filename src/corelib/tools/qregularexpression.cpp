comment|/*!     \class QRegularExpression     \inmodule QtCore     \reentrant      \brief The QRegularExpression class provides pattern matching using regular     expressions.      \since 5.0      \ingroup tools     \ingroup shared      \keyword regular expression      Regular expressions, or \e{regexps}, are a very powerful tool to handle     strings and texts. This is useful in many contexts, e.g.,      \table     \row \li Validation          \li A regexp can test whether a substring meets some criteria,          e.g. is an integer or contains no whitespace.     \row \li Searching          \li A regexp provides more powerful pattern matching than          simple substring matching, e.g., match one of the words          \e{mail}, \e{letter} or \e{correspondence}, but none of the          words \e{email}, \e{mailman}, \e{mailer}, \e{letterbox}, etc.     \row \li Search and Replace          \li A regexp can replace all occurrences of a substring with a          different substring, e.g., replace all occurrences of \e{&}          with \e{\&amp;} except where the \e{&} is already followed by          an \e{amp;}.     \row \li String Splitting          \li A regexp can be used to identify where a string should be          split apart, e.g. splitting tab-delimited strings.     \endtable      This document is by no means a complete reference to pattern matching using     regular expressions, and the following parts will require the reader to     have some basic knowledge about Perl-like regular expressions and their     pattern syntax.      Good references about regular expressions include:      \list     \li \e {Mastering Regular Expressions} (Third Edition) by Jeffrey E. F.     Friedl, ISBN 0-596-52812-4;     \li the \l{http://pcre.org/pcre.txt} {pcrepattern(3)} man page, describing     the pattern syntax supported by PCRE (the reference implementation of     Perl-compatible regular expressions);     \li the \l{http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html} {Perl's regular expression     documentation} and the \l{http://perldoc.perl.org/perlretut.html} {Perl's     regular expression tutorial}.     \endlist      \tableofcontents      \section1 Introduction      QRegularExpression implements Perl-compatible regular expressions. It fully     supports Unicode. For an overview of the regular expression syntax     supported by QRegularExpression, please refer to the aforementioned     pcrepattern(3) man page. A regular expression is made up of two things: a     \b{pattern string} and a set of \b{pattern options} that change the     meaning of the pattern string.      You can set the pattern string by passing a string to the QRegularExpression     constructor:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 0      This sets the pattern string to \c{a pattern}. You can also use the     setPattern() function to set a pattern on an existing QRegularExpression     object:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 1      Note that due to C++ literal strings rules, you must escape all backslashes     inside the pattern string with another backslash:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 2      The pattern() function returns the pattern that is currently set for a     QRegularExpression object:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 3      \section1 Pattern options      The meaning of the pattern string can be modified by setting one or more     \e{pattern options}. For instance, it is possible to set a pattern to match     case insensitively by setting the QRegularExpression::CaseInsensitiveOption.      You can set the options by passing them to the QRegularExpression     constructor, as in:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 4      Alternatively, you can use the setPatternOptions() function on an existing     QRegularExpressionObject:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 5      It is possible to get the pattern options currently set on a     QRegularExpression object by using the patternOptions() function:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 6      Please refer to the QRegularExpression::PatternOption enum documentation for     more information about each pattern option.      \section1 Match type and match options      The last two arguments of the match() and the globalMatch() functions set     the match type and the match options. The match type is a value of the     QRegularExpression::MatchType enum; the "traditional" matching algorithm is     chosen by using the NormalMatch match type (the default). It is also     possible to enable partial matching of the regular expression against a     subject string: see the \l{partial matching} section for more details.      The match options are a set of one or more QRegularExpression::MatchOption     values. They change the way a specific match of a regular expression     against a subject string is done. Please refer to the     QRegularExpression::MatchOption enum documentation for more details.      \target normal matching     \section1 Normal matching      In order to perform a match you can simply invoke the match() function     passing a string to match against. We refer to this string as the     \e{subject string}. The result of the match() function is a     QRegularExpressionMatch object that can be used to inspect the results of     the match. For instance:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 7      If a match is successful, the (implicit) capturing group number 0 can be     used to retrieve the substring matched by the entire pattern (see also the     section about \l{extracting captured substrings}):      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 8      It's also possible to start a match at an arbitrary offset inside the     subject string by passing the offset as an argument of the     match() function. In the following example \c{"12 abc"}     is not matched because the match is started at offset 1:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 9      \target extracting captured substrings     \section2 Extracting captured substrings      The QRegularExpressionMatch object contains also information about the     substrings captured by the capturing groups in the pattern string. The     \l{QRegularExpressionMatch::}{captured()} function will return the string     captured by the n-th capturing group:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 10      Capturing groups in the pattern are numbered starting from 1, and the     implicit capturing group 0 is used to capture the substring that matched     the entire pattern.      It's also possible to retrieve the starting and the ending offsets (inside     the subject string) of each captured substring, by using the     \l{QRegularExpressionMatch::}{capturedStart()} and the     \l{QRegularExpressionMatch::}{capturedEnd()} functions:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 11      All of these functions have an overload taking a QString as a parameter     in order to extract \e{named} captured substrings. For instance:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 12      \target global matching     \section1 Global matching      \e{Global matching} is useful to find all the occurrences of a given     regular expression inside a subject string. Suppose that we want to extract     all the words from a given string, where a word is a substring matching     the pattern \c{\w+}.      QRegularExpression::globalMatch returns a QRegularExpressionMatchIterator,     which is a Java-like forward iterator that can be used to iterate over the     results. For instance:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 13      Since it's a Java-like iterator, the QRegularExpressionMatchIterator will     point immediately before the first result. Every result is returned as a     QRegularExpressionMatch object. The     \l{QRegularExpressionMatchIterator::}{hasNext()} function will return true     if there's at least one more result, and     \l{QRegularExpressionMatchIterator::}{next()} will return the next result     and advance the iterator. Continuing from the previous example:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 14      You can also use \l{QRegularExpressionMatchIterator::}{peekNext()} to get     the next result without advancing the iterator.      It is possible to pass a starting offset and one or more match options to     the globalMatch() function, exactly like normal matching with match().      \target partial matching     \section1 Partial matching      A \e{partial match} is obtained when the end of the subject string is     reached, but more characters are needed to successfully complete the match.     Note that a partial match is usually much more inefficient than a normal     match because many optimizations of the matching algorithm cannot be     employed.      A partial match must be explicitly requested by specifying a match type of     PartialPreferCompleteMatch or PartialPreferFirstMatch when calling     QRegularExpression::match or QRegularExpression::globalMatch. If a partial     match is found, then calling the \l{QRegularExpressionMatch::}{hasMatch()}     function on the QRegularExpressionMatch object returned by match() will     return \c{false}, but \l{QRegularExpressionMatch::}{hasPartialMatch()} will return     \c{true}.      When a partial match is found, no captured substrings are returned, and the     (implicit) capturing group 0 corresponding to the whole match captures the     partially matched substring of the subject string.      Note that asking for a partial match can still lead to a complete match, if     one is found; in this case, \l{QRegularExpressionMatch::}{hasMatch()} will     return \c{true} and \l{QRegularExpressionMatch::}{hasPartialMatch()}     \c{false}. It never happens that a QRegularExpressionMatch reports both a     partial and a complete match.      Partial matching is mainly useful in two scenarios: validating user input     in real time and incremental/multi-segment matching.      \target validating user input     \section2 Validating user input      Suppose that we would like the user to input a date in a specific     format, for instance "MMM dd, yyyy". We can check the input validity with     a pattern like:      \c{^(Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug|Sep|Oct|Nov|Dec) \d\d?, \d\d\d\d$}      (This pattern doesn't catch invalid days, but let's keep it for the     example's purposes).      We would like to validate the input with this regular expression \e{while}     the user is typing it, so that we can report an error in the input as soon     as it is committed (for instance, the user typed the wrong key). In order     to do so we must distinguish three cases:      \list     \li the input cannot possibly match the regular expression;     \li the input does match the regular expression;     \li the input does not match the regular expression right now,     but it will if more characters will be added to it.     \endlist      Note that these three cases represent exactly the possible states of a     QValidator (see the QValidator::State enum).      In particular, in the last case we want the regular expression engine to     report a partial match: we are successfully matching the pattern against     the subject string but the matching cannot continue because the end of the     subject is encountered. Notice, however, that the matching algorithm should     continue and try all possibilities, and in case a complete (non-partial)     match is found, then this one should be reported, and the input string     accepted as fully valid.      This behaviour is implemented by the PartialPreferCompleteMatch match type.     For instance:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 15      If matching the same regular expression against the subject string leads to     a complete match, it is reported as usual:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 16      Another example with a different pattern, showing the behaviour of     preferring a complete match over a partial one:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 17      In this case, the subpattern \c{abc\\w+X} partially matches the subject     string; however, the subpattern \c{def} matches the subject string     completely, and therefore a complete match is reported.      If multiple partial matches are found when matching (but no complete     match), then the QRegularExpressionMatch object will report the first one     that is found. For instance:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 18      \section2 Incremental/multi-segment matching      Incremental matching is another use case of partial matching. Suppose that     we want to find the occurrences of a regular expression inside a large text     (that is, substrings matching the regular expression). In order to do so we     would like to "feed" the large text to the regular expression engines in     smaller chunks. The obvious problem is what happens if the substring that     matches the regular expression spans across two or more chunks.      In this case, the regular expression engine should report a partial match,     so that we can match again adding new data and (eventually) get a complete     match. This implies that the regular expression engine may assume that     there are other characters \e{beyond the end} of the subject string. This     is not to be taken literally -- the engine will never try to access     any character after the last one in the subject.      QRegularExpression implements this behaviour when using the     PartialPreferFirstMatch match type. This match type reports a partial match     as soon as it is found, and other match alternatives are not tried     (even if they could lead to a complete match). For instance:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 19      This happens because when matching the first branch of the alternation     operator a partial match is found, and therefore matching stops, without     trying the second branch. Another example:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 20      This shows what could seem a counterintuitve behaviour of quantifiers:     since \c{?} is greedy, then the engine tries first to continue the match     after having matched \c{"abc"}; but then the matching reaches the end of the     subject string, and therefore a partial match is reported. This is     even more surprising in the following example:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 21      It's easy to understand this behaviour if we remember that the engine     expects the subject string to be only a substring of the whole text we're     looking for a match into (that is, how we said before, that the engine     assumes that there are other characters beyond the end of the subject     string).      Since the \c{*} quantifier is greedy, then reporting a complete match could     be an error, because after the current subject \c{"abc"} there may be other     occurrences of \c{"abc"}. For instance, the complete text could have been     "abcabcX", and therefore the \e{right} match to report (in the complete     text) would have been \c{"abcabc"}; by matching only against the leading     \c{"abc"} we instead get a partial match.      \section1 Error handling      It is possible for a QRegularExpression object to be invalid because of     syntax errors in the pattern string. The isValid() function will return     true if the regular expression is valid, or false otherwise:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 22      You can get more information about the specific error by calling the     errorString() function; moreover, the patternErrorOffset() function     will return the offset inside the pattern string      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 23      If a match is attempted with an invalid QRegularExpression, then the     returned QRegularExpressionMatch object will be invalid as well (that is,     its \l{QRegularExpressionMatch::}{isValid()} function will return false).     The same applies for attempting a global match.      \section1 Unsupported Perl-compatible regular expressions features      QRegularExpression does not support all the features available in     Perl-compatible regular expressions. The most notable one is the fact that     duplicated names for capturing groups are not supported, and using them can     lead to undefined behaviour.      This may change in a future version of Qt.      \section1 Notes for QRegExp users      The QRegularExpression class introduced in Qt 5 is a big improvement upon     QRegExp, in terms of APIs offered, supported pattern syntax and speed of     execution. The biggest difference is that QRegularExpression simply holds a     regular expression, and it's \e{not} modified when a match is requested.     Instead, a QRegularExpressionMatch object is returned, in order to check     the result of a match and extract the captured substring. The same applies     with global matching and QRegularExpressionMatchIterator.      Other differences are outlined below.      \section2 Exact matching      QRegExp::exactMatch() in Qt 4 served two purposes: it exactly matched     a regular expression against a subject string, and it implemented partial     matching. In fact, if an exact match was not found, one could still find     out how much of the subject string was matched by the regular expression     by calling QRegExp::matchedLength(). If the returned length was equal     to the subject string's length, then one could desume that a partial match     was found.      QRegularExpression supports partial matching explicitly by means of the     appropriate MatchType. If instead you simply want to be sure that the     subject string matches the regular expression exactly, you can wrap the     pattern between a couple of anchoring expressions. Simply     putting the pattern between the \c{^} and the \c{$} anchors is enough     in most cases:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 24      However, remember that the \c{$} anchor not only matches at the end of the     string, but also at a newline character right before the end of the string;     that is, the previous pattern matches against the string "this pattern must     match exactly\\n". Also, the behaviour of both the \c{^} and the \c{$}     anchors changes if the MultiLineOption is set either explicitly (as a     pattern option) or implicitly (as a directive inside the pattern string).      Therefore, in the most general case, you should wrap the pattern between     the \c{\A} and the \c{\z} anchors:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregularexpression.cpp 25      Note the usage of the non-capturing group in order to preserve the meaning     of the branch operator inside the pattern.      \section2 Global matching      Due to limitations of the QRegExp API it was impossible to implement global     matching correctly (that is, like Perl does). In particular, patterns that     can match 0 characters (like \c{"a*"}) are problematic.      QRegularExpression::globalMatch() implements Perl global match correctly, and     the returned iterator can be used to examine each result.      \section2 Unicode properties support      When using QRegExp, character classes such as \c{\w}, \c{\d}, etc. match     characters with the corresponding Unicode property: for instance, \c{\d}     matches any character with the Unicode Nd (decimal digit) property.      Those character classes only match ASCII characters by default when using     QRegularExpression: for instance, \c{\d} matches exactly a character in the     \c{0-9} ASCII range. It is possible to change this behaviour by using the     UseUnicodePropertiesOption pattern option.      \section2 Wildcard matching      There is no equivalent of wildcard matching in QRegularExpression.     Nevertheless, rewriting a regular expression in wildcard syntax to a     Perl-compatible regular expression is a very easy task, given the fact     that wildcard syntax supported by QRegExp is very simple.      \section2 Other pattern syntaxes      QRegularExpression supports only Perl-compatible regular expressions.      \section2 Minimal matching      QRegExp::setMinimal() implemented minimal matching by simply reversing the     greediness of the quantifiers (QRegExp did not support lazy quantifiers,     like \c{*?}, \c{+?}, etc.). QRegularExpression instead does support greedy,     lazy and possessive quantifiers. The InvertedGreedinessOption     pattern option can be useful to emulate the effects of QRegExp::setMinimal():     if enabled, it inverts the greediness of quantifiers (greedy ones become     lazy and vice versa).      \section2 Caret modes      The AnchoredMatchOption match option can be used to emulate the     QRegExp::CaretAtOffset behaviour. There is no equivalent for the other     QRegExp::CaretMode modes.      \section1 Debugging code that uses QRegularExpression      QRegularExpression internally uses a just in time compiler (JIT) to     optimize the execution of the matching algorithm. The JIT makes extensive     usage of self-modifying code, which can lead debugging tools such as     Valgrind to crash. You must enable all checks for self-modifying code if     you want to debug programs using QRegularExpression (f.i., see Valgrind's     \c{--smc-check} command line option). The downside of enabling such checks     is that your program will run considerably slower.      To avoid that, the JIT is disabled by default if you compile Qt in debug     mode. It is possible to override the default and enable or disable the JIT     usage (both in debug or release mode) by setting the     \c{QT_ENABLE_REGEXP_JIT} environment variable to a non-zero or zero value     respectively.      \sa QRegularExpressionMatch, QRegularExpressionMatchIterator */

comment|/*!     \enum QRegularExpression::PatternOption      The PatternOption enum defines modifiers to the way the pattern string     should be interpreted, and therefore the way the pattern matches against a     subject string.      \value NoPatternOption         No pattern options are set.      \value CaseInsensitiveOption         The pattern should match against the subject string in a case         insensitive way. This option corresponds to the /i modifier in Perl         regular expressions.      \value DotMatchesEverythingOption         The dot metacharacter (\c{.}) in the pattern string is allowed to match         any character in the subject string, including newlines (normally, the         dot does not match newlines). This option corresponds to the \c{/s}         modifier in Perl regular expressions.      \value MultilineOption         The caret (\c{^}) and the dollar (\c{$}) metacharacters in the pattern         string are allowed to match, respectively, immediately after and         immediately before any newline in the subject string, as well as at the         very beginning and at the very end of the subject string. This option         corresponds to the \c{/m} modifier in Perl regular expressions.      \value ExtendedPatternSyntaxOption         Any whitespace in the pattern string which is not escaped and outside a         character class is ignored. Moreover, an unescaped sharp (\b{#})         outside a character class causes all the following characters, until         the first newline (included), to be ignored. This can be used to         increase the readability of a pattern string as well as put comments         inside regular expressions; this is particulary useful if the pattern         string is loaded from a file or written by the user, because in C++         code it is always possible to use the rules for string literals to put         comments outside the pattern string. This option corresponds to the \c{/x}         modifier in Perl regular expressions.      \value InvertedGreedinessOption         The greediness of the quantifiers is inverted: \c{*}, \c{+}, \c{?},         \c{{m,n}}, etc. become lazy, while their lazy versions (\c{*?},         \c{+?}, \c{??}, \c{{m,n}?}, etc.) become greedy. There is no equivalent         for this option in Perl regular expressions.      \value DontCaptureOption         The non-named capturing groups do not capture substrings; named         capturing groups still work as intended, as well as the implicit         capturing group number 0 corresponding to the entire match. There is no         equivalent for this option in Perl regular expressions.      \value UseUnicodePropertiesOption         The meaning of the \c{\w}, \c{\d}, etc., character classes, as well as         the meaning of their counterparts (\c{\W}, \c{\D}, etc.), is changed         from matching ASCII characters only to matching any character with the         corresponding Unicode property. For instance, \c{\d} is changed to         match any character with the Unicode Nd (decimal digit) property;         \c{\w} to match any character with either the Unicode L (letter) or N         (digit) property, plus underscore, and so on. This option corresponds         to the \c{/u} modifier in Perl regular expressions. */
comment|/*!     \enum QRegularExpression::MatchType      The MatchType enum defines the type of the match that should be attempted     against the subject string.      \value NormalMatch         A normal match is done.      \value PartialPreferCompleteMatch         The pattern string is matched partially against the subject string. If         a partial match is found, then it is recorded, and other matching         alternatives are tried as usual. If a complete match is then found,         then it's preferred to the partial match; in this case only the         complete match is reported. If instead no complete match is found (but         only the partial one), then the partial one is reported.      \value PartialPreferFirstMatch         The pattern string is matched partially against the subject string. If         a partial match is found, then matching stops and the partial match is         reported. In this case, other matching alternatives (potentially         leading to a complete match) are not tried. Moreover, this match type         assumes that the subject string only a substring of a larger text, and         that (in this text) there are other characters beyond the end of the         subject string. This can lead to surprising results; see the discussion         in the \l{partial matching} section for more details. */
comment|/*!     \enum QRegularExpression::MatchOption      \value NoMatchOption         No match options are set.      \value AnchoredMatchOption         The match is constrained to start exactly at the offset passed to         match() in order to be successful, even if the pattern string does not         contain any metacharacter that anchors the match at that point. */

comment|/*!     \internal      The purpose of the function is to call pcre16_study (which allows some     optimizations to be performed, including JIT-compiling the pattern), and     setting the studyData member variable to the result of the study. It gets     called by doMatch() every time a match is performed. As of now, the     optimizations on the pattern are performed after a certain number of usages     (i.e. the qt_qregularexpression_optimize_after_use_count constant).      Notice that although the method is protected by a mutex, one thread may     invoke this function and return immediately (i.e. not study the pattern,     leaving studyData to NULL); but before calling pcre16_exec to perform the     match, another thread performs the studying and sets studyData to something     else. Although the assignment to studyData is itself atomic, the release of     the memory pointed by studyData isn't. Therefore, the current studyData     value is returned and used by doMatch. */

It also advances a match if a previous result is given as \a     previous. The \a subject string goes a Unicode validity check if     \a checkSubjectString is true (PCRE doesn't like illegal UTF-16 sequences).      Advancing a match is a tricky algorithm. If the previous match matched a     non-empty string, we just do an ordinary match at the offset position.      If the previous match matched an empty string, then an anchored, non-empty     match is attempted at the offset position. If that succeeds, then we got     the next match and we can return it. Otherwise, we advance by 1 position     (which can be one or two code units in UTF-16!) and reattempt a "normal"     match. We also have the problem of detecting the current newline format: if     the new advanced offset is pointing to the beginning of a CRLF sequence, we     must advance over it. */
