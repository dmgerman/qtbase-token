It     behaves exactly like a normal pointer for normal purposes,     including respect for constness.      QSharedPointer will delete the pointer it is holding when it goes     out of scope, provided no other QSharedPointer objects are     referencing it.      A QSharedPointer object can be created from a normal pointer,     another QSharedPointer object or by promoting a     QWeakPointer object to a strong reference.      \section1 Thread-Safety      QSharedPointer and QWeakPointer are thread-safe and operate     atomically on the pointer value. Different threads can also access     the QSharedPointer or QWeakPointer pointing to the same object at     the same time without need for locking mechanisms.      It should be noted that, while the pointer value can be accessed     in this manner, QSharedPointer and QWeakPointer provide no     guarantee about the object being pointed to. Thread-safety and     reentrancy rules for that object still apply.      \section1 Other Pointer Classes      Qt also provides two other pointer wrapper classes: QPointer and     QSharedDataPointer. They are incompatible with one another, since     each has its very different use case.      QSharedPointer holds a shared pointer by means of an external     reference count (i.e., a reference counter placed outside the     object). Like its name indicates, the pointer value is shared     among all instances of QSharedPointer and QWeakPointer. The     contents of the object pointed to by the pointer should not be     considered shared, however: there is only one object. For that     reason, QSharedPointer does not provide a way to detach or make     copies of the pointed object.      QSharedDataPointer, on the other hand, holds a pointer to shared     data (i.e., a class derived from QSharedData). It does so by means     of an internal reference count, placed in the QSharedData base     class. This class can, therefore, detach based on the type of     access made to the data being guarded: if it's a non-const access,     it creates a copy atomically for the operation to complete.      QExplicitlySharedDataPointer is a variant of QSharedDataPointer, except     that it only detaches if QExplicitlySharedDataPointer::detach() is     explicitly called (hence the name).      QScopedPointer simply holds a pointer to a heap allocated object and     deletes it in its destructor. This class is useful when an object needs to     be heap allocated and deleted, but no more. QScopedPointer is lightweight,     it makes no use of additional structure or reference counting.      Finally, QPointer holds a pointer to a QObject-derived object, but it     does so weakly. QWeakPointer has the same functionality, but its use for     that function is deprecated.      \section1 Optional pointer tracking      A feature of QSharedPointer that can be enabled at compile-time for     debugging purposes is a pointer tracking mechanism. When enabled,     QSharedPointer registers in a global set all the pointers that it tracks.     This allows one to catch mistakes like assigning the same pointer to two     QSharedPointer objects.      This function is enabled by defining the \tt{QT_SHAREDPOINTER_TRACK_POINTERS}     macro before including the QSharedPointer header.      It is safe to use this feature even with code compiled without the     feature. QSharedPointer will ensure that the pointer is removed from the     tracker even from code compiled without pointer tracking.      Note, however, that the pointer tracking feature has limitations on     multiple- or virtual-inheritance (that is, in cases where two different     pointer addresses can refer to the same object). In that case, if a     pointer is cast to a different type and its value changes,     QSharedPointer's pointer tracking mechanism may fail to detect that the     object being tracked is the same.      \omit     \secton1 QSharedPointer internals      QSharedPointer is in reality implemented by two ancestor classes:     QtSharedPointer::Basic and QtSharedPointer::ExternalRefCount. The reason     for having that split is now mostly legacy: in the beginning,     QSharedPointer was meant to support both internal reference counting and     external reference counting.      QtSharedPointer::Basic implements the basic functionality that is shared     between internal- and external-reference counting. That is, it's mostly     the accessor functions into QSharedPointer. Those are all inherited by     QSharedPointer, which adds another level of shared functionality (the     constructors and assignment operators). The Basic class has one member     variable, which is the actual pointer being tracked.      QtSharedPointer::ExternalRefCount implements the actual reference     counting and introduces the d-pointer for QSharedPointer. That d-pointer     itself is shared with other QSharedPointer objects as well as     QWeakPointer.      The reason for keeping the pointer value itself outside the d-pointer is     because of multiple inheritance needs. If you have two QSharedPointer     objects of different pointer types, but pointing to the same object in     memory, it could happen that the pointer values are different. The \tt     differentPointers autotest exemplifies this problem. The same thing could     happen in the case of virtual inheritance: a pointer of class matching     the virtual base has different address compared to the pointer of the     complete object. See the \tt virtualBaseDifferentPointers autotest for     this problem.      The d pointer is a pointer to QtSharedPointer::ExternalRefCountData, but it     always points to one of the two classes derived from ExternalRefCountData.      \section2 d-pointer     \section3 QtSharedPointer::ExternalRefCountData      It is basically a reference-counted reference-counter plus a pointer to the     function to be used to delete the pointer. It has three members: \tt     strongref, \tt weakref, and \tt destroyer. The strong reference counter is     controlling the lifetime of the object tracked by QSharedPointer. A     positive value indicates that the object is alive. It's also the number of     QSharedObject instances that are attached to this Data.      When the strong reference count decreases to zero, the object is deleted     (see below for information on custom deleters). The strong reference     count can also exceptionally be -1, indicating that there are no     QSharedPointers attached to an object, which is tracked too. The only     case where this is possible is that of QWeakPointers tracking a QObject.      The weak reference count controls the lifetime of the d-pointer itself.     It can be thought of as an internal/intrusive reference count for     ExternalRefCountData itself. This count is equal to the number of     QSharedPointers and QWeakPointers that are tracking this object. (In case     the object tracked derives from QObject, this number is increased by 1,     since QObjectPrivate tracks it too).      The third member is a pointer to the function that is used to delete the     pointer being tracked. That happens when the destroy() function is called.      The size of this class is the size of the two atomic ints plus the size of     a pointer. On 32-bit architectures, that's 12 bytes, whereas on 64-bit ones     it's 16 bytes. There is no padding.      \section3 QtSharedPointer::ExternalRefCountWithCustomDeleter      This class derives from ExternalRefCountData and is a     template class. As template parameters, it has the type of the pointer     being tracked (\tt T) and a \tt Deleter, which is anything. It adds two     fields to its parent class, matching those template parameters: a member     of type \tt Deleter and a member of type \tt T*.      The purpose of this class is to store the pointer to be deleted and the     deleter code along with the d-pointer. This allows the last strong     reference to call any arbitrary function that disposes of the object. For     example, this allows calling QObject::deleteLater() on a given object.     The pointer to the object is kept here to avoid the extra cost of keeping     the deleter in the generic case.      This class is never instantiated directly: the constructors and     destructor are private and, in C++11, deleted. Only the create() function     may be called to return an object of this type. See below for construction     details.      The size of this class depends on the size of \tt Deleter. If it's an empty     functor (i.e., no members), ABIs generally assign it the size of 1. But     given that it's followed by a pointer, padding bytes may be inserted so     that the alignment of the class and of the pointer are correct. In that     case, the size of this class is 12+4+4 = 20 bytes on 32-bit architectures,     or 16+8+8 = 40 bytes on 64-bit architectures. If \tt Deleter is a function     pointer, the size should be the same as the empty structure case. If \tt     Deleter is a pointer to a member function (PMF), the size will be bigger     and will depend on the ABI. For architectures using the Itanium C++ ABI, a     PMF is twice the size of a normal pointer. In that case, the size of this     structure will be 12+8+4 = 24 bytes on 32-bit architectures, 16+16+8 = 40     bytes on 64-bit ones.      If the deleter was not specified when creating the QSharedPointer object     (i.e., if a standard \tt delete call is expected), then there's an     optimization that avoids the need to store another function pointer in     ExternalRefCountWithCustomDeleter. Instead, a template specialization makes     a direct delete call. The size of the structure, in this case, is 12+4 = 16     bytes on 32-bit architectures, 16+8 = 24 bytes on 64-bit ones.      \section3 QtSharedPointer::ExternalRefCountWithContiguousData      This class also derives from ExternalRefCountData and it is     also a template class. The template parameter is the type \tt T of the     class which QSharedPointer tracks. It adds only one member to its parent,     which is of type \tt T (the actual type, not a pointer to it).      The purpose of this class is to lay the \tt T object out next to the     reference counts, saving one memory allocation per shared pointer. This     is particularly interesting for small \tt T or for the cases when there     are few if any QWeakPointer tracking the object. This class exists to     implement the QSharedPointer::create() call.      Like ExternalRefCountWithCustomDeleter, this class is never instantiated     directly. This class also provides a create() member that returns the     pointer, and hides its constructors and destructor. With C++11, they're     deleted.      The size of this class depends on the size of \tt T.      \section3 Instantiating ExternalRefCountWithCustomDeleter and ExternalRefCountWithContiguousData      Like explained above, these classes have private constructors. Moreover,     they are not defined anywhere, so trying to call \tt{new ClassType} would     result in a compilation or linker error. Instead, these classes must be     constructed via their create() methods.      Instead of instantiating the class by the normal way, the create() method     calls \tt{operator new} directly with the size of the class, then calls     the parent class's constructor only (that is, ExternalRefCountData's constructor).     This ensures that the inherited members are initialised properly.      After initialising the base class, the     ExternalRefCountWithCustomDeleter::create() function initialises the new     members directly, by using the placement \tt{operator new}. In the case     of the ExternalRefCountWithContiguousData::create() function, the address     to the still-uninitialised \tt T member is saved for the callee to use.     The member is only initialised in QSharedPointer::create(), so that we     avoid having many variants of the internal functions according to the     arguments in use for calling the constructor.      When initialising the parent class, the create() functions pass the     address of the static deleter() member function. That is, when the     destroy() function is called by QSharedPointer, the deleter() functions     are called instead. These functions static_cast the ExternalRefCountData*     parameter to their own type and execute their deletion: for the     ExternalRefCountWithCustomDeleter::deleter() case, it runs the user's     custom deleter, then destroys the deleter; for     ExternalRefCountWithContiguousData::deleter, it simply calls the \tt T     destructor directly.      Only one non-inline function is required per template, which is     the deleter() static member. All the other functions can be inlined.     What's more, the address of deleter() is calculated only in code, which     can be resolved at link-time if the linker can determine that the     function lies in the current application or library module (since these     classes are not exported, that is the case for Windows or for builds with     \tt{-fvisibility=hidden}).      \section3 Modifications due to pointer-tracking      To ensure that pointers created with pointer-tracking enabled get     un-tracked when destroyed, even if destroyed by code compiled without the     feature, QSharedPointer modifies slightly the instructions of the     previous sections.      When ExternalRefCountWithCustomDeleter or     ExternalRefCountWithContiguousData are used, their create() functions     will set the ExternalRefCountData::destroyer function     pointer to safetyCheckDeleter() instead. These static member functions     simply call internalSafetyCheckRemove() before passing control to the     normal deleter() function.      If neither custom deleter nor QSharedPointer::create() are used, then     QSharedPointer uses a custom deleter of its own: the normalDeleter()     function, which simply calls \tt delete. By using a custom deleter, the     safetyCheckDeleter() procedure described above kicks in.      \endomit      \sa QSharedDataPointer, QWeakPointer, QScopedPointer */

comment|/*!     \class QWeakPointer     \inmodule QtCore     \brief The QWeakPointer class holds a weak reference to a shared pointer     \since 4.5     \reentrant      The QWeakPointer is an automatic weak reference to a     pointer in C++. It cannot be used to dereference the pointer     directly, but it can be used to verify if the pointer has been     deleted or not in another context.      QWeakPointer objects can only be created by assignment from a     QSharedPointer.      It's important to note that QWeakPointer provides no automatic casting     operators to prevent mistakes from happening. Even though QWeakPointer     tracks a pointer, it should not be considered a pointer itself, since it     doesn't guarantee that the pointed object remains valid.      Therefore, to access the pointer that QWeakPointer is tracking, you must     first promote it to QSharedPointer and verify if the resulting object is     null or not. QSharedPointer guarantees that the object isn't deleted, so     if you obtain a non-null object, you may use the pointer. See     QWeakPointer::toStrongRef() for an example.      QWeakPointer also provides the QWeakPointer::data() method that returns     the tracked pointer without ensuring that it remains valid. This function     is provided if you can guarantee by external means that the object will     not get deleted (or if you only need the pointer value) and the cost of     creating a QSharedPointer using toStrongRef() is too high.      \omit     \secton1 QWeakPointer internals      QWeakPointer shares most of its internal functionality with     \l{QSharedPointer#qsharedpointer-internals}{QSharedPointer}, so see that     class's internal documentation for more information.      QWeakPointer requires an external reference counter in order to operate.     Therefore, it is incompatible by design with \l QSharedData-derived     classes.      It has a special QObject constructor, which works by calling     QtSharedPointer::ExternalRefCountData::getAndRef, which retrieves the     d-pointer from QObjectPrivate. If one isn't set yet, that function     creates the d-pointer and atomically sets it.      If getAndRef needs to create a d-pointer, it sets the strongref to -1,     indicating that the QObject is not shared: QWeakPointer is used only to     determine whether the QObject has been deleted. In that case, it cannot     be upgraded to QSharedPointer (see the previous section).      \endomit      \sa QSharedPointer, QScopedPointer */

The \a deleter parameter specifies the custom deleter for this     object. The custom deleter is called, instead of the operator delete(),     when the strong reference count drops to 0. This is useful,     for instance, for calling deleteLater() on a QObject instead:      \code     static void doDeleteLater(MyObject *obj)     {         obj->deleteLater();     }      void otherFunction()     {         QSharedPointer<MyObject> obj =             QSharedPointer<MyObject>(new MyObject, doDeleteLater);          // continue using obj         obj.clear();    // calls obj->deleteLater();     }     \endcode      It is also possible to specify a member function directly, as in:     \code         QSharedPointer<MyObject> obj =             QSharedPointer<MyObject>(new MyObject,&QObject::deleteLater);     \endcode      \sa clear() */

comment|/*!     \fn T *QWeakPointer::data() const     \since 4.6      Returns the value of the pointer being tracked by this QWeakPointer,     \b without ensuring that it cannot get deleted. To have that guarantee,     use toStrongRef(), which returns a QSharedPointer object. If this     function can determine that the pointer has already been deleted, it     returns 0.      It is ok to obtain the value of the pointer and using that value itself,     like for example in debugging statements:      \code         qDebug("Tracking %p", weakref.data());     \endcode      However, dereferencing the pointer is only allowed if you can guarantee     by external means that the pointer does not get deleted. For example,     if you can be certain that no other thread can delete it, nor the     functions that you may call.      If that is the case, then the following code is valid:      \code         // this pointer cannot be used in another thread         // so other threads cannot delete it         QWeakPointer<int> weakref = obtainReference();          Object *obj = weakref.data();         if (obj) {             // if the pointer wasn't deleted yet, we know it can't get             // deleted by our own code here nor the functions we call             otherFunction(obj);         }     \endcode      Use this function with care.      \sa isNull(), toStrongRef() */

comment|/*!     \fn QSharedPointer<T> QWeakPointer::toStrongRef() const      Promotes this weak reference to a strong one and returns a     QSharedPointer object holding that reference. When promoting to     QSharedPointer, this function verifies if the object has been deleted     already or not. If it hasn't, this function increases the reference     count to the shared object, thus ensuring that it will not get     deleted.      Since this function can fail to obtain a valid strong reference to the     shared object, you should always verify if the conversion succeeded,     by calling QSharedPointer::isNull() on the returned object.      For example, the following code promotes a QWeakPointer that was held     to a strong reference and, if it succeeded, it prints the value of the     integer that was held:      \code         QWeakPointer<int> weakref;          // ...          QSharedPointer<int> strong = weakref.toStrongRef();         if (strong)             qDebug()<< "The value is:"<< *strong;         else             qDebug()<< "The value has already been deleted";     \endcode      \sa QSharedPointer::QSharedPointer() */
