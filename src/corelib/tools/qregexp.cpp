This is useful in many contexts, e.g.,      \table     \row \li Validation          \li A regexp can test whether a substring meets some criteria,          e.g. is an integer or contains no whitespace.     \row \li Searching          \li A regexp provides more powerful pattern matching than          simple substring matching, e.g., match one of the words          \e{mail}, \e{letter} or \e{correspondence}, but none of the          words \e{email}, \e{mailman}, \e{mailer}, \e{letterbox}, etc.      \row \li Search and Replace          \li A regexp can replace all occurrences of a substring with a          different substring, e.g., replace all occurrences of \e{&}          with \e{\&amp;} except where the \e{&} is already followed by          an \e{amp;}.     \row \li String Splitting          \li A regexp can be used to identify where a string should be          split apart, e.g. splitting tab-delimited strings.     \endtable      A brief introduction to regexps is presented, a description of     Qt's regexp language, some examples, and the function     documentation itself. QRegExp is modeled on Perl's regexp     language. It fully supports Unicode. QRegExp can also be used in a     simpler, \e{wildcard mode} that is similar to the functionality     found in command shells. The syntax rules used by QRegExp can be     changed with setPatternSyntax(). In particular, the pattern syntax     can be set to QRegExp::FixedString, which means the pattern to be     matched is interpreted as a plain string, i.e., special characters     (e.g., backslash) are not escaped.      A good text on regexps is \e {Mastering Regular Expressions}     (Third Edition) by Jeffrey E. F.  Friedl, ISBN 0-596-52812-4.      \tableofcontents      \section1 Introduction      Regexps are built up from expressions, quantifiers, and     assertions. The simplest expression is a character, e.g. \b{x}     or \b{5}. An expression can also be a set of characters     enclosed in square brackets. \b{[ABCD]} will match an \b{A}     or a \b{B} or a \b{C} or a \b{D}. We can write this same     expression as \b{[A-D]}, and an experession to match any     captital letter in the English alphabet is written as     \b{[A-Z]}.      A quantifier specifies the number of occurrences of an expression     that must be matched. \b{x{1,1}} means match one and only one     \b{x}. \b{x{1,5}} means match a sequence of \b{x}     characters that contains at least one \b{x} but no more than     five.      Note that in general regexps cannot be used to check for balanced     brackets or tags. For example, a regexp can be written to match an     opening html \c{<b>} and its closing \c{</b>}, if the \c{<b>} tags     are not nested, but if the \c{<b>} tags are nested, that same     regexp will match an opening \c{<b>} tag with the wrong closing     \c{</b>}.  For the fragment \c{<b>bold<b>bolder</b></b>}, the     first \c{<b>} would be matched with the first \c{</b>}, which is     not correct. However, it is possible to write a regexp that will     match nested brackets or tags correctly, but only if the number of     nesting levels is fixed and known. If the number of nesting levels     is not fixed and known, it is impossible to write a regexp that     will not fail.      Suppose we want a regexp to match integers in the range 0 to 99.     At least one digit is required, so we start with the expression     \b{[0-9]{1,1}}, which matches a single digit exactly once. This     regexp matches integers in the range 0 to 9. To match integers up     to 99, increase the maximum number of occurrences to 2, so the     regexp becomes \b{[0-9]{1,2}}. This regexp satisfies the     original requirement to match integers from 0 to 99, but it will     also match integers that occur in the middle of strings. If we     want the matched integer to be the whole string, we must use the     anchor assertions, \b{^} (caret) and \b{$} (dollar). When     \b{^} is the first character in a regexp, it means the regexp     must match from the beginning of the string. When \b{$} is the     last character of the regexp, it means the regexp must match to     the end of the string. The regexp becomes \b{^[0-9]{1,2}$}.     Note that assertions, e.g. \b{^} and \b{$}, do not match     characters but locations in the string.      If you have seen regexps described elsewhere, they may have looked     different from the ones shown here. This is because some sets of     characters and some quantifiers are so common that they have been     given special symbols to represent them. \b{[0-9]} can be     replaced with the symbol \b{\\d}. The quantifier to match     exactly one occurrence, \b{{1,1}}, can be replaced with the     expression itself, i.e. \b{x{1,1}} is the same as \b{x}. So     our 0 to 99 matcher could be written as \b{^\\d{1,2}$}. It can     also be written \b{^\\d\\d{0,1}$}, i.e. \e{From the start of     the string, match a digit, followed immediately by 0 or 1 digits}.     In practice, it would be written as \b{^\\d\\d?$}. The \b{?}     is shorthand for the quantifier \b{{0,1}}, i.e. 0 or 1     occurrences. \b{?} makes an expression optional. The regexp     \b{^\\d\\d?$} means \e{From the beginning of the string, match     one digit, followed immediately by 0 or 1 more digit, followed     immediately by end of string}.      To write a regexp that matches one of the words 'mail' \e or     'letter' \e or 'correspondence' but does not match words that     contain these words, e.g., 'email', 'mailman', 'mailer', and     'letterbox', start with a regexp that matches 'mail'. Expressed     fully, the regexp is \b{m{1,1}a{1,1}i{1,1}l{1,1}}, but because     a character expression is automatically quantified by     \b{{1,1}}, we can simplify the regexp to \b{mail}, i.e., an     'm' followed by an 'a' followed by an 'i' followed by an 'l'. Now     we can use the vertical bar \b{|}, which means \b{or}, to     include the other two words, so our regexp for matching any of the     three words becomes \b{mail|letter|correspondence}. Match     'mail' \b{or} 'letter' \b{or} 'correspondence'. While this     regexp will match one of the three words we want to match, it will     also match words we don't want to match, e.g., 'email'.  To     prevent the regexp from matching unwanted words, we must tell it     to begin and end the match at word boundaries. First we enclose     our regexp in parentheses, \b{(mail|letter|correspondence)}.     Parentheses group expressions together, and they identify a part     of the regexp that we wish to \l{capturing text}{capture}.     Enclosing the expression in parentheses allows us to use it as a     component in more complex regexps. It also allows us to examine     which of the three words was actually matched. To force the match     to begin and end on word boundaries, we enclose the regexp in     \b{\\b} \e{word boundary} assertions:     \b{\\b(mail|letter|correspondence)\\b}.  Now the regexp means:     \e{Match a word boundary, followed by the regexp in parentheses,     followed by a word boundary}. The \b{\\b} assertion matches a     \e position in the regexp, not a \e character. A word boundary is     any non-word character, e.g., a space, newline, or the beginning     or ending of a string.      If we want to replace ampersand characters with the HTML entity     \b{\&amp;}, the regexp to match is simply \b{\&}. But this     regexp will also match ampersands that have already been converted     to HTML entities. We want to replace only ampersands that are not     already followed by \b{amp;}. For this, we need the negative     lookahead assertion, \b{(?!}__\b{)}. The regexp can then be     written as \b{\&(?!amp;)}, i.e. \e{Match an ampersand that is}     \b{not} \e{followed by} \b{amp;}.      If we want to count all the occurrences of 'Eric' and 'Eirik' in a     string, two valid solutions are \b{\\b(Eric|Eirik)\\b} and     \b{\\bEi?ri[ck]\\b}. The word boundary assertion '\\b' is     required to avoid matching words that contain either name,     e.g. 'Ericsson'. Note that the second regexp matches more     spellings than we want: 'Eric', 'Erik', 'Eiric' and 'Eirik'.      Some of the examples discussed above are implemented in the     \l{#code-examples}{code examples} section.      \target characters-and-abbreviations-for-sets-of-characters     \section1 Characters and Abbreviations for Sets of Characters      \table     \header \li Element \li Meaning     \row \li \b{c}          \li A character represents itself unless it has a special          regexp meaning. e.g. \b{c} matches the character \e c.     \row \li \b{\\c}          \li A character that follows a backslash matches the character          itself, except as specified below. e.g., To match a literal          caret at the beginning of a string, write \b{\\^}.     \row \li \b{\\a}          \li Matches the ASCII bell (BEL, 0x07).     \row \li \b{\\f}          \li Matches the ASCII form feed (FF, 0x0C).     \row \li \b{\\n}          \li Matches the ASCII line feed (LF, 0x0A, Unix newline).     \row \li \b{\\r}          \li Matches the ASCII carriage return (CR, 0x0D).     \row \li \b{\\t}          \li Matches the ASCII horizontal tab (HT, 0x09).     \row \li \b{\\v}          \li Matches the ASCII vertical tab (VT, 0x0B).     \row \li \b{\\x\e{hhhh}}          \li Matches the Unicode character corresponding to the          hexadecimal number \e{hhhh} (between 0x0000 and 0xFFFF).     \row \li \b{\\0\e{ooo}} (i.e., \\zero \e{ooo})          \li matches the ASCII/Latin1 character for the octal number          \e{ooo} (between 0 and 0377).     \row \li \b{. (dot)}          \li Matches any character (including newline).     \row \li \b{\\d}          \li Matches a digit (QChar::isDigit()).     \row \li \b{\\D}          \li Matches a non-digit.     \row \li \b{\\s}          \li Matches a whitespace character (QChar::isSpace()).     \row \li \b{\\S}          \li Matches a non-whitespace character.     \row \li \b{\\w}          \li Matches a word character (QChar::isLetterOrNumber(), QChar::isMark(), or '_').     \row \li \b{\\W}          \li Matches a non-word character.     \row \li \b{\\\e{n}}          \li The \e{n}-th \l backreference, e.g. \\1, \\2, etc.     \endtable      \b{Note:} The C++ compiler transforms backslashes in strings.     To include a \b{\\} in a regexp, enter it twice, i.e. \c{\\}.     To match the backslash character itself, enter it four times, i.e.     \c{\\\\}.      \target sets-of-characters     \section1 Sets of Characters      Square brackets mean match any character contained in the square     brackets. The character set abbreviations described above can     appear in a character set in square brackets. Except for the     character set abbreviations and the following two exceptions,      characters do not have special meanings in square brackets.      \table     \row \li \b{^}           \li The caret negates the character set if it occurs as the          first character (i.e. immediately after the opening square          bracket). \b{[abc]} matches 'a' or 'b' or 'c', but          \b{[^abc]} matches anything \e but 'a' or 'b' or 'c'.      \row \li \b{-}           \li The dash indicates a range of characters. \b{[W-Z]}          matches 'W' or 'X' or 'Y' or 'Z'.      \endtable      Using the predefined character set abbreviations is more portable     than using character ranges across platforms and languages. For     example, \b{[0-9]} matches a digit in Western alphabets but     \b{\\d} matches a digit in \e any alphabet.      Note: In other regexp documentation, sets of characters are often     called "character classes".      \target quantifiers     \section1 Quantifiers      By default, an expression is automatically quantified by     \b{{1,1}}, i.e. it should occur exactly once. In the following     list, \b{\e {E}} stands for expression. An expression is a     character, or an abbreviation for a set of characters, or a set of     characters in square brackets, or an expression in parentheses.      \table     \row \li \b{\e {E}?}           \li Matches zero or one occurrences of \e E. This quantifier          means \e{The previous expression is optional}, because it          will match whether or not the expression is found. \b{\e          {E}?} is the same as \b{\e {E}{0,1}}. e.g., \b{dents?}          matches 'dent' or 'dents'.      \row \li \b{\e {E}+}           \li Matches one or more occurrences of \e E. \b{\e {E}+} is          the same as \b{\e {E}{1,}}. e.g., \b{0+} matches '0',          '00', '000', etc.      \row \li \b{\e {E}*}           \li Matches zero or more occurrences of \e E. It is the same          as \b{\e {E}{0,}}. The \b{*} quantifier is often used          in error where \b{+} should be used. For example, if          \b{\\s*$} is used in an expression to match strings that          end in whitespace, it will match every string because          \b{\\s*$} means \e{Match zero or more whitespaces followed          by end of string}. The correct regexp to match strings that          have at least one trailing whitespace character is          \b{\\s+$}.      \row \li \b{\e {E}{n}}           \li Matches exactly \e n occurrences of \e E. \b{\e {E}{n}}          is the same as repeating \e E \e n times. For example,          \b{x{5}} is the same as \b{xxxxx}. It is also the same          as \b{\e {E}{n,n}}, e.g. \b{x{5,5}}.      \row \li \b{\e {E}{n,}}          \li Matches at least \e n occurrences of \e E.      \row \li \b{\e {E}{,m}}          \li Matches at most \e m occurrences of \e E. \b{\e {E}{,m}}          is the same as \b{\e {E}{0,m}}.      \row \li \b{\e {E}{n,m}}          \li Matches at least \e n and at most \e m occurrences of \e E.     \endtable      To apply a quantifier to more than just the preceding character,     use parentheses to group characters together in an expression. For     example, \b{tag+} matches a 't' followed by an 'a' followed by     at least one 'g', whereas \b{(tag)+} matches at least one     occurrence of 'tag'.      Note: Quantifiers are normally "greedy". They always match as much     text as they can. For example, \b{0+} matches the first zero it     finds and all the consecutive zeros after the first zero. Applied     to '20005', it matches'2\underline{000}5'. Quantifiers can be made     non-greedy, see setMinimal().      \target capturing parentheses     \target backreferences     \section1 Capturing Text      Parentheses allow us to group elements together so that we can     quantify and capture them. For example if we have the expression     \b{mail|letter|correspondence} that matches a string we know     that \e one of the words matched but not which one. Using     parentheses allows us to "capture" whatever is matched within     their bounds, so if we used \b{(mail|letter|correspondence)}     and matched this regexp against the string "I sent you some email"     we can use the cap() or capturedTexts() functions to extract the     matched characters, in this case 'mail'.      We can use captured text within the regexp itself. To refer to the     captured text we use \e backreferences which are indexed from 1,     the same as for cap(). For example we could search for duplicate     words in a string using \b{\\b(\\w+)\\W+\\1\\b} which means match a     word boundary followed by one or more word characters followed by     one or more non-word characters followed by the same text as the     first parenthesized expression followed by a word boundary.      If we want to use parentheses purely for grouping and not for     capturing we can use the non-capturing syntax, e.g.     \b{(?:green|blue)}. Non-capturing parentheses begin '(?:' and     end ')'. In this example we match either 'green' or 'blue' but we     do not capture the match so we only know whether or not we matched     but not which color we actually found. Using non-capturing     parentheses is more efficient than using capturing parentheses     since the regexp engine has to do less book-keeping.      Both capturing and non-capturing parentheses may be nested.      \target greedy quantifiers      For historical reasons, quantifiers (e.g. \b{*}) that apply to     capturing parentheses are more "greedy" than other quantifiers.     For example, \b{a*(a*)} will match "aaa" with cap(1) == "aaa".     This behavior is different from what other regexp engines do     (notably, Perl). To obtain a more intuitive capturing behavior,     specify QRegExp::RegExp2 to the QRegExp constructor or call     setPatternSyntax(QRegExp::RegExp2).      \target cap_in_a_loop      When the number of matches cannot be determined in advance, a     common idiom is to use cap() in a loop. For example:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregexp.cpp 0      \target assertions     \section1 Assertions      Assertions make some statement about the text at the point where     they occur in the regexp but they do not match any characters. In     the following list \b{\e {E}} stands for any expression.      \table     \row \li \b{^}          \li The caret signifies the beginning of the string. If you          wish to match a literal \c{^} you must escape it by          writing \c{\\^}. For example, \b{^#include} will only          match strings which \e begin with the characters '#include'.          (When the caret is the first character of a character set it          has a special meaning, see \l{#sets-of-characters}{Sets of Characters}.)      \row \li \b{$}          \li The dollar signifies the end of the string. For example          \b{\\d\\s*$} will match strings which end with a digit          optionally followed by whitespace. If you wish to match a          literal \c{$} you must escape it by writing          \c{\\$}.      \row \li \b{\\b}          \li A word boundary. For example the regexp          \b{\\bOK\\b} means match immediately after a word          boundary (e.g. start of string or whitespace) the letter 'O'          then the letter 'K' immediately before another word boundary          (e.g. end of string or whitespace). But note that the          assertion does not actually match any whitespace so if we          write \b{(\\bOK\\b)} and we have a match it will only          contain 'OK' even if the string is "It's \underline{OK} now".      \row \li \b{\\B}          \li A non-word boundary. This assertion is true wherever          \b{\\b} is false. For example if we searched for          \b{\\Bon\\B} in "Left on" the match would fail (space          and end of string aren't non-word boundaries), but it would          match in "t\underline{on}ne".      \row \li \b{(?=\e E)}          \li Positive lookahead. This assertion is true if the          expression matches at this point in the regexp. For example,          \b{const(?=\\s+char)} matches 'const' whenever it is          followed by 'char', as in 'static \underline{const} char *'.          (Compare with \b{const\\s+char}, which matches 'static          \underline{const char} *'.)      \row \li \b{(?!\e E)}          \li Negative lookahead. This assertion is true if the          expression does not match at this point in the regexp. For          example, \b{const(?!\\s+char)} matches 'const' \e except          when it is followed by 'char'.     \endtable      \keyword QRegExp wildcard matching     \section1 Wildcard Matching      Most command shells such as \e bash or \e cmd.exe support "file     globbing", the ability to identify a group of files by using     wildcards. The setPatternSyntax() function is used to switch     between regexp and wildcard mode. Wildcard matching is much     simpler than full regexps and has only four features:      \table     \row \li \b{c}          \li Any character represents itself apart from those mentioned          below. Thus \b{c} matches the character \e c.     \row \li \b{?}          \li Matches any single character. It is the same as          \b{.} in full regexps.     \row \li \b{*}          \li Matches zero or more of any characters. It is the          same as \b{.*} in full regexps.     \row \li \b{[...]}          \li Sets of characters can be represented in square brackets,          similar to full regexps. Within the character class, like          outside, backslash has no special meaning.     \endtable      In the mode Wildcard, the wildcard characters cannot be     escaped. In the mode WildcardUnix, the character '\\' escapes the     wildcard.      For example if we are in wildcard mode and have strings which     contain filenames we could identify HTML files with \b{*.html}.     This will match zero or more characters followed by a dot followed     by 'h', 't', 'm' and 'l'.      To test a string against a wildcard expression, use exactMatch().     For example:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregexp.cpp 1      \target perl-users     \section1 Notes for Perl Users      Most of the character class abbreviations supported by Perl are     supported by QRegExp, see \l{#characters-and-abbreviations-for-sets-of-characters}     {characters and abbreviations for sets of characters}.      In QRegExp, apart from within character classes, \c{^} always     signifies the start of the string, so carets must always be     escaped unless used for that purpose. In Perl the meaning of caret     varies automagically depending on where it occurs so escaping it     is rarely necessary. The same applies to \c{$} which in     QRegExp always signifies the end of the string.      QRegExp's quantifiers are the same as Perl's greedy quantifiers     (but see the \l{greedy quantifiers}{note above}). Non-greedy     matching cannot be applied to individual quantifiers, but can be     applied to all the quantifiers in the pattern. For example, to     match the Perl regexp \b{ro+?m} requires:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregexp.cpp 2      The equivalent of Perl's \c{/i} option is     setCaseSensitivity(Qt::CaseInsensitive).      Perl's \c{/g} option can be emulated using a \l{#cap_in_a_loop}{loop}.      In QRegExp \b{.} matches any character, therefore all QRegExp     regexps have the equivalent of Perl's \c{/s} option. QRegExp     does not have an equivalent to Perl's \c{/m} option, but this     can be emulated in various ways for example by splitting the input     into lines or by looping with a regexp that searches for newlines.      Because QRegExp is string oriented, there are no \\A, \\Z, or \\z     assertions. The \\G assertion is not supported but can be emulated     in a loop.      Perl's $& is cap(0) or capturedTexts()[0]. There are no QRegExp     equivalents for $`, $' or $+. Perl's capturing variables, $1, $2,     ... correspond to cap(1) or capturedTexts()[1], cap(2) or     capturedTexts()[2], etc.      To substitute a pattern use QString::replace().      Perl's extended \c{/x} syntax is not supported, nor are     directives, e.g. (?i), or regexp comments, e.g. (?#comment). On     the other hand, C++'s rules for literal strings can be used to     achieve the same:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregexp.cpp 3      Both zero-width positive and zero-width negative lookahead     assertions (?=pattern) and (?!pattern) are supported with the same     syntax as Perl. Perl's lookbehind assertions, "independent"     subexpressions and conditional expressions are not supported.      Non-capturing parentheses are also supported, with the same     (?:pattern) syntax.      See QString::split() and QStringList::join() for equivalents     to Perl's split and join functions.      Note: because C++ transforms \\'s they must be written \e twice in     code, e.g. \b{\\b} must be written \b{\\\\b}.      \target code-examples     \section1 Code Examples      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregexp.cpp 4      The third string matches '\underline{6}'. This is a simple validation     regexp for integers in the range 0 to 99.      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregexp.cpp 5      The second string matches '\underline{This_is-OK}'. We've used the     character set abbreviation '\\S' (non-whitespace) and the anchors     to match strings which contain no whitespace.      In the following example we match strings containing 'mail' or     'letter' or 'correspondence' but only match whole words i.e. not     'email'      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregexp.cpp 6      The second string matches "Please write the \underline{letter}". The     word 'letter' is also captured (because of the parentheses). We     can see what text we've captured like this:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregexp.cpp 7      This will capture the text from the first set of capturing     parentheses (counting capturing left parentheses from left to     right). The parentheses are counted from 1 since cap(0) is the     whole matched regexp (equivalent to '&' in most regexp engines).      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregexp.cpp 8      Here we've passed the QRegExp to QString's replace() function to     replace the matched text with new text.      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregexp.cpp 9      We've used the indexIn() function to repeatedly match the regexp in     the string. Note that instead of moving forward by one character     at a time \c pos++ we could have written \c {pos +=     rx.matchedLength()} to skip over the already matched string. The     count will equal 3, matching 'One \underline{Eric} another     \underline{Eirik}, and an Ericsson. How many Eiriks, \underline{Eric}?'; it     doesn't match 'Ericsson' or 'Eiriks' because they are not bounded     by non-word boundaries.      One common use of regexps is to split lines of delimited data into     their component fields.      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregexp.cpp 10      In this example our input lines have the format company name, web     address and country. Unfortunately the regexp is rather long and     not very versatile -- the code will break if we add any more     fields. A simpler and better solution is to look for the     separator, '\\t' in this case, and take the surrounding text. The     QString::split() function can take a separator string or regexp     as an argument and split a string accordingly.      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregexp.cpp 11      Here field[0] is the company, field[1] the web address and so on.      To imitate the matching of a shell we can use wildcard mode.      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregexp.cpp 12      Wildcard matching can be convenient because of its simplicity, but     any wildcard regexp can be defined using full regexps, e.g.     \b{.*\\.html$}. Notice that we can't match both \c .html and \c     .htm files with a wildcard unless we use \b{*.htm*} which will     also match 'test.html.bak'. A full regexp gives us the precision     we need, \b{.*\\.html?$}.      QRegExp can match case insensitively using setCaseSensitivity(),     and can use non-greedy matching, see setMinimal(). By     default QRegExp uses full regexps but this can be changed with     setWildcard(). Searching can be forward with indexIn() or backward     with lastIndexIn(). Captured text can be accessed using     capturedTexts() which returns a string list of all captured     strings, or using cap() which returns the captured string for the     given index. The pos() function takes a match index and returns     the position in the string where the match was made (or -1 if     there was no match).      \sa QString, QStringList, QRegExpValidator, QSortFilterProxyModel,         {tools/regexp}{Regular Expression Example} */

(2) If the regular   expression is trivial, the good-string heuristic should be used.   (3) If the search is case insensitive, the good-string heuristic   should be used, unless it scores 0. (Case insensitivity turns all   entries of occ1 to 0.) (4) If (goodLateStart - goodEarlyStart) is   big, the good-string heuristic should score less. */

This is     the default.      \value RegExp2 Like RegExp, but with \l{greedy quantifiers}.     (Introduced in Qt 4.2.)      \value Wildcard This provides a simple pattern matching syntax     similar to that used by shells (command interpreters) for "file     globbing". See \l{Wildcard Matching}.      \value WildcardUnix This is similar to Wildcard but with the     behavior of a Unix shell. The wildcard characters can be escaped     with the character "\\".      \value FixedString The pattern is a fixed string. This is     equivalent to using the RegExp pattern on a string in     which all metacharacters are escaped using escape().      \value W3CXmlSchema11 The pattern is a regular expression as     defined by the W3C XML Schema 1.1 specification.      \sa setPatternSyntax() */

Each     subsequent list element contains a string that matched a     (capturing) subexpression of the regexp.      For example:     \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregexp.cpp 14      The above example also captures elements that may be present but     which we have no interest in. This problem can be solved by using     non-capturing parentheses:      \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregexp.cpp 15      Note that if you want to iterate over the list, you should iterate     over a copy, e.g.     \snippet code/src_corelib_tools_qregexp.cpp 16      Some regexps can match an indeterminate number of times. For     example if the input string is "Offsets: 12 14 99 231 7" and the     regexp, \c{rx}, is \b{(\\d+)+}, we would hope to get a list of     all the numbers matched. However, after calling     \c{rx.indexIn(str)}, capturedTexts() will return the list ("12",     "12"), i.e. the entire match was "12" and the first subexpression     matched was "12". The correct approach is to use cap() in a     \l{QRegExp#cap_in_a_loop}{loop}.      The order of elements in the string list is as follows. The first     element is the entire matching string. Each subsequent element     corresponds to the next capturing open left parentheses. Thus     capturedTexts()[1] is the text of the first capturing parentheses,     capturedTexts()[2] is the text of the second and so on     (corresponding to $1, $2, etc., in some other regexp languages).      \sa cap(), pos() */
