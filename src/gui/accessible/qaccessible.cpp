comment|/*!     \class QAccessible     \brief The QAccessible class provides enums and static functions     related to accessibility.      \ingroup accessibility     \inmodule QtGui      This class is part of \l {Accessibility for QWidget Applications}.      Accessible applications can be used by people who are not able to     use applications by conventional means.      The functions in this class are used for communication between     accessible applications (also called AT Servers) and     accessibility tools (AT Clients), such as screen readers and     braille displays. Clients and servers communicate in the following way:      \list     \li  \e{AT Servers} notify the clients about events through calls to the         updateAccessibility() function.      \li  \e{AT Clients} request information about the objects in the server.         The QAccessibleInterface class is the core interface, and encapsulates         this information in a pure virtual API. Implementations of the interface         are provided by Qt through the queryAccessibleInterface() API.     \endlist      The communication between servers and clients is initialized by     the setRootObject() function. Function pointers can be installed     to replace or extend the default behavior of the static functions     in QAccessible.      Qt supports Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA), Mac OS X     Accessibility, and the Unix/X11 AT-SPI standard. Other backends     can be supported using QAccessibleBridge.      In addition to QAccessible's static functions, Qt offers one     generic interface, QAccessibleInterface, that can be used to wrap     all widgets and objects (e.g., QPushButton). This single     interface provides all the metadata necessary for the assistive     technologies. Qt provides implementations of this interface for     its built-in widgets as plugins.      When you develop custom widgets, you can create custom subclasses     of QAccessibleInterface and distribute them as plugins (using     QAccessiblePlugin) or compile them into the application.     Likewise, Qt's predefined accessibility support can be built as     plugin (the default) or directly into the Qt library. The main     advantage of using plugins is that the accessibility classes are     only loaded into memory if they are actually used; they don't     slow down the common case where no assistive technology is being     used.      Qt also includes two convenience classes, QAccessibleObject and     QAccessibleWidget, that inherit from QAccessibleInterface and     provide the lowest common denominator of metadata (e.g., widget     geometry, window title, basic help text). You can use them as     base classes when wrapping your custom QObject or QWidget     subclasses.      \sa QAccessibleInterface */
comment|/*!     \class QAccessible::State      \inmodule QtGui      This structure defines bit flags that indicate     the state of an accessible object. The values are:      \value active                  The object is the active window or the active sub-element in a container (that would get focus when focusing the container).     \value adjustable              The object represents an adjustable value, e.g. sliders.     \value animated                The object's appearance changes frequently.     \value busy                    The object cannot accept input at the moment.     \value checkable               The object is checkable.     \value checked                 The object's check box is checked.     \value checkStateMixed         The third state of checkboxes (half checked in tri-state check boxes).     \value collapsed               The object is collapsed, e.g. a closed listview item, or an iconified window.     \value defaultButton           The object represents the default button in a dialog.     \value defunct                 The object no longer exists.     \value editable                The object has a text carret (and often implements the text interface).     \value expandable              The object is expandable, mostly used for cells in a tree view.     \value expanded                The object is expanded, currently its children are visible.     \value extSelectable           The object supports extended selection.     \value focusable               The object can receive focus. Only objects in the active window can receive focus.     \value focused                 The object has keyboard focus.     \value hasPopup                The object opens a popup.     \value hotTracked              The object's appearance is sensitive to the mouse cursor position.     \value invalid                 The object is no longer valid (because it has been deleted).     \value invalidEntry            Input validation current input invalid.     \value invisible               The object is not visible to the user.     \value linked                  The object is linked to another object, e.g. a hyperlink.     \value marqueed                The object displays scrolling contents, e.g. a log view.     \value modal                   The object blocks input from other objects.     \value movable                 The object can be moved.     \value multiLine               The object has multiple lines of text (word wrap), as opposed to a single line.     \value multiSelectable         The object supports multiple selected items.     \value offscreen               The object is clipped by the visible area. Objects that are off screen are also invisible.     \value passwordEdit            The object is a password field, e.g. a line edit for entering a Password.     \value playsSound              The object produces sound when interacted with.     \value pressed                 The object is pressed.     \value readOnly                The object can usually be edited, but is explicitly set to read-only.     \value selectable              The object is selectable.     \value selectableText          The object has text which can be selected. This is different from selectable which refers to the object's children.     \value selected                The object is selected.     \value selfVoicing             The object describes itself through speech or sound.     \value sizeable                The object can be resized, e.g. top-level windows.     \value summaryElement          The object summarizes the state of the window and should be treated with priority.     \value supportsAutoCompletion  The object has auto-completion, for example in line edits or combo boxes.     \value traversed               The object is linked and has been visited.     \value updatesFrequently       The object changes frequently and needs to be refreshed when accessing it.     \value disabled                The object is unavailable to the user, e.g. a disabled widget.      Implementations of QAccessibleInterface::state() return a combination     of these flags. */

Any children the object that is hidden has do not send                                             this event. It is not sent when an object is hidden as                                             it is being obcured by others.     \value ObjectReorder                    A layout or item view  has added, removed, or moved an                                             object (Qt does not use this event).     \value ObjectShow                       An object is displayed; for example, with                                             QWidget::show().     \value PageChanged     \value ParentChanged                    An object's parent object changed.     \value PopupMenuEnd                     A pop-up menu has closed.     \value PopupMenuStart                   A pop-up menu has opened.     \value ScrollingEnd                     A scrollbar scroll operation has ended (the mouse has                                             released the slider handle).     \value ScrollingStart                   A scrollbar scroll operation is about to start; this may                                             be caused by a mouse press on the slider handle, for                                             example.     \value SectionChanged     \value SelectionAdd                     An item has been added to the selection in an item view.     \value SelectionRemove                  An item has been removed from an item view selection.     \value Selection                        The selection has changed in a menu or item view.     \value SelectionWithin                  Several changes to a selection has occurred in an item                                             view.     \value SoundPlayed                      A sound has been played by an object     \omitvalue StateChanged                 The QAccessible::State of an object has changed.                                             This value is used internally for the QAccessibleStateChangeEvent.     \value TableCaptionChanged              A table caption has been changed.     \value TableColumnDescriptionChanged    The description of a table column, typically found in                                             the column's header, has been changed.     \value TableColumnHeaderChanged         A table column header has been changed.     \omitvalue TableModelChanged                The model providing data for a table has been changed.     \value TableRowDescriptionChanged       The description of a table row, typically found in the                                             row's header, has been changed.     \value TableRowHeaderChanged            A table row header has been changed.     \value TableSummaryChanged              The summary of a table has been changed.     \omitvalue TextAttributeChanged     \omitvalue TextCaretMoved                   The caret has moved in an editable widget.                                             The caret represents the cursor position in an editable                                             widget with the input focus.     \value TextColumnChanged                A text column has been changed.     \omitvalue TextInserted                     Text has been inserted into an editable widget.     \omitvalue TextRemoved                      Text has been removed from an editable widget.     \omitvalue TextSelectionChanged             The selected text has changed in an editable widget.     \omitvalue TextUpdated                      The text has been update in an editable widget.     \omitvalue ValueChanged                     The QAccessible::Value of an object has changed.     \value VisibleDataChanged      The values for this enum are defined to be the same as those defined in the     \l{AccessibleEventID.idl File Reference}{IAccessible2} and     \l{Microsoft Active Accessibility Event Constants}{MSAA} specifications. */

For example, the type \c ValueChange indicates that the position of   a slider has been changed.    Call this function whenever the state of your accessible object or   one of its sub-elements has been changed either programmatically   (e.g. by calling QLabel::setText()) or by user interaction.    If there are no accessibility tools listening to this event, the   performance penalty for calling this function is small, but if   determining the parameters of the call is expensive you can test   QAccessible::isActive() to avoid unnecessary computation. */

comment|/*!     \class QAccessibleInterface     \brief The QAccessibleInterface class defines an interface that exposes information     about accessible objects.      \ingroup accessibility     \inmodule QtGui      This class is part of \l {Accessibility for QWidget Applications}.      Accessibility tools (also called AT Clients), such as screen readers     or braille displays, require high-level information about     accessible objects in an application. Accessible objects provide     specialized input and output methods, making it possible for users     to use accessibility tools with enabled applications (AT Servers).      Every element that the user needs to interact with or react to is     an accessible object, and should provide this information. These     are mainly visual objects, such as widgets and widget elements, but     can also be content, such as sounds.      The AT client uses three basic concepts to acquire information     about any accessible object in an application:     \list     \li \e Properties The client can read information about     accessible objects. In some cases the client can also modify these     properties; such as text in a line edit.     \li \e Actions The client can invoke actions like pressing a button     or .     \li \e{Relationships and Navigation} The client can traverse from one     accessible object to another, using the relationships between objects.     \endlist      The QAccessibleInterface defines the API for these three concepts.      \section1 Relationships and Navigation      The functions childCount() and indexOfChild() return the number of     children of an accessible object and the index a child object has     in its parent. The childAt() function returns a child QAccessibleInterface     that is found at a position. The child does not have to be a direct     child. This allows bypassing intermediate layers when the parent already knows the     top-most child. childAt() is used for hit testing (finding the object     under the mouse).      The relations() function provides information about the relations an     object has to other objects, and parent() and child() allows     traversing from one object to another object.      \section1 Properties      The central property of an accessible objects is what role() it     has. Different objects can have the same role, e.g. both the "Add     line" element in a scroll bar and the \c OK button in a dialog have     the same role, "button". The role implies what kind of     interaction the user can perform with the user interface element.      An object's state() property is a combination of different state     flags and can describe both how the object's state differs from a     "normal" state, e.g. it might be unavailable, and also how it     behaves, e.g. it might be selectable.      The text() property provides textual information about the object.     An object usually has a name, but can provide extended information     such as a description, help text, or information about any     keyboard accelerators it provides. Some objects allow changing the     text() property through the setText() function, but this     information is in most cases read-only.      The rect() property provides information about the geometry of an     accessible object. This information is usually only available for     visual objects.      \section1 Interfaces      To enable the user to interact with an accessible object the     object must implement QAccessibleActionInterface in addition to     QAccessibleInterface.     Objects that support selections can define actions to change the selection.      There are several other interfaces that should be implemented as required.     QAccessibleTextInterface should be used for bigger texts edits such as document views.     This interface should not be implemented for labels/single line edits.      For sliders, scrollbars and other numerical value selectors QAccessibleValueInterface     should be implemented.      Lists, tables and trees should implement QAccessibleTableInterface.      \sa QAccessible, QAccessibleActionInterface, QAccessibleTextInterface, QAccessibleValueInterface, QAccessibleTableInterface */

comment|/*!     \fn QString QAccessibleInterface::text(QAccessible::Text t) const      Returns the value of the text property \a t of the object.      The \l QAccessible::Name is a string used by clients to identify, find, or     announce an accessible object for the user. All objects must have     a name that is unique within their container. The name can be     used differently by clients, so the name should both give a     short description of the object and be unique.      An accessible object's \l QAccessible::Description provides textual information     about an object's visual appearance. The description is primarily     used to provide greater context for vision-impaired users, but is     also used for context searching or other applications. Not all     objects have a description. An "OK" button would not need a     description, but a tool button that shows a picture of a smiley     would.      The \l QAccessible::Value of an accessible object represents visual information     contained by the object, e.g. the text in a line edit. Usually,     the value can be modified by the user. Not all objects have a     value, e.g. static text labels don't, and some objects have a     state that already is the value, e.g. toggle buttons.      The \l QAccessible::Help text provides information about the function and     usage of an accessible object. Not all objects provide this     information.      The \l QAccessible::Accelerator is a keyboard shortcut that activates the     object's default action. A keyboard shortcut is the underlined     character in the text of a menu, menu item or widget, and is     either the character itself, or a combination of this character     and a modifier key like Alt, Ctrl or Shift. Command controls like     tool buttons also have shortcut keys and usually display them in     their tooltip.      All objects provide a string for \l QAccessible::Name.      \sa role(), state() */

This class is used with \l QAccessible::updateAccessibility().      The event type is one of the values of \l QAccessible::Event.     There are a number of subclasses that should be used to provide more details about the     event.      For example to notify about a focus change when re-implementing QWidget::setFocus,     the event could be used as follows:     \code     void MyWidget::setFocus(Qt::FocusReason reason)     {         // handle custom focus setting...         QAccessibleEvent event(f, QAccessible::Focus);         QAccessible::updateAccessibility(&event);     }     \endcode      To enable in process screen readers, all events must be sent after the change has happened. */

comment|/*!     \class QAccessibleTextInterface     \inmodule QtGui      \ingroup accessibility      \brief The QAccessibleTextInterface class implements support for text handling.      This interface corresponds to the IAccessibleText interface.     It should be implemented for widgets that display more text than a plain label.     Labels should be represented by only \l QAccessibleInterface     and return their text as name (\l QAccessibleInterface::text() with \l QAccessible::Name as type).     The QAccessibleTextInterface is typically for text that a screen reader     might want to read line by line, and for widgets that support text selection and input.     This interface is, for example, implemented for QLineEdit.      \l{IAccessible2 Specification} */

comment|/*!     \class QAccessibleActionInterface     \ingroup accessibility      \brief The QAccessibleActionInterface class implements support for     invocable actions in the interface.      Accessible objects should implement the action interface if they support user interaction.     Usually this interface is implemented by classes that also implement \l QAccessibleInterface.      The supported actions should use the predefined actions offered in this class unless they do not     fit a predefined action. In that case a custom action can be added.      When subclassing QAccessibleActionInterface you need to provide a list of actionNames which     is the primary means to discover the available actions. Action names are never localized.     In order to present actions to the user there are two functions that need to return localized versions     of the name and give a description of the action. For the predefined action names use     \l QAccessibleActionInterface::localizedActionName() and \l QAccessibleActionInterface::localizedActionDescription()     to return their localized counterparts.      In general you should use one of the predefined action names, unless describing an action that does not fit these:     \table     \header \li Action name         \li Description     \row    \li \l toggleAction()   \li toggles the item (checkbox, radio button, switch, ...)     \row    \li \l decreaseAction() \li decrease the value of the accessible (e.g. spinbox)     \row    \li \l increaseAction() \li increase the value of the accessible (e.g. spinbox)     \row    \li \l pressAction()    \li press or click or activate the accessible (should correspont to clicking the object with the mouse)     \row    \li \l setFocusAction() \li set the focus to this accessible     \row    \li \l showMenuAction() \li show a context menu, corresponds to right-clicks     \endtable      In order to invoke the action, \l doAction() is called with an action name.      Most widgets will simply implement \l pressAction(). This is what happens when the widget is activated by     being clicked, space pressed or similar.      \l{IAccessible2 Specification} */
