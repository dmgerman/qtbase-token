A debug message has a textual representation, a vendor-specific numeric id,     a source, a type and a severity.      It's also possible for applications or third-party libraries and toolkits     to create and insert messages in the debug log.

comment|/*!     \class QOpenGLDebugLogger     \brief The QOpenGLDebugLogger enables logging of OpenGL debugging messages.     \inmodule QtGui     \since 5.1     \ingroup painting-3D      \tableofcontents      \section1 Introduction      OpenGL programming can be very error prone. Most of the time, a single     failing call to OpenGL can cause an entire portion of an application to     stop working, with nothing being drawn on the screen.      The only way to be sure that no errors are being returned from the OpenGL     implementation is checking with \c{glGetError} after each and every API     call. Moreover, OpenGL errors stack up, therefore glGetError should always     be used in a loop like this:      \code      GLenum error = GL_NO_ERROR;     do {         error = glGetError();         if (error != GL_NO_ERROR)             // handle the error     } while (error != GL_NO_ERROR);      \endcode      There are also many other information we are interested in (as application     developers), for instance performance issues, or warnings about using     deprecated APIs. Those kind of messages are not reported through the     ordinary OpenGL error reporting mechanisms.      QOpenGLDebugLogger aims at addressing these issues by providing access to     the \e{OpenGL debug log}. If your OpenGL implementation supports it (by     exposing the \c{GL_KHR_debug} extension), messages from the OpenGL server     will be either logged in an internal OpenGL log, or passed in "real-time"     to listeners as they're generated from OpenGL.      QOpenGLDebugLogger supports both these modes of operation. Refer to the     following sections to find out the differences between them.      \section1 Creating an OpenGL debug context      For efficiency reasons, OpenGL implementations are allowed not to create     any debug output at all, unless the OpenGL context is a debug context. In order     to create a debug context from Qt, you must set the QSurfaceFormat::DebugContext     format option on the QSurfaceFormat used to create the QOpenGLContext object:      \code      QSurfaceFormat format;     // asks for a OpenGL 3.2 debug context using the Core profile     format.setMajorVersion(3);     format.setMinorVersion(2);     format.setProfile(QSurfaceFormat::CoreProfile);     format.setOption(QSurfaceFormat::DebugContext);      QOpenGLContext *context = new QOpenGLContext;     context->setFormat(format);     context->create();      \endcode      Note that requesting a 3.2 OpenGL Core Profile is just for the example's     purposes; this class is not tied to any specific OpenGL or OpenGL ES     version, as it relies on the availability of the \c{GL_KHR_debug} extension     (see below).      \section1 Creating and initializing a QOpenGLDebugLogger      QOpenGLDebugLogger is a simple QObject-derived class. Just like all QObject     subclasses, you create an instance (and optionally specify a parent     object), and like the other OpenGL functions in Qt you \e{must} initialize     it before usage by calling initialize() whilst there is a current OpenGL context:      \code      QOpenGLContext *ctx = QOpenGLContext::currentContext();     QOpenGLDebugLogger *logger = new QOpenGLDebugLogger(this);      logger->initialize(); // initializes in the current context, i.e. ctx      \endcode      Note that the \c{GL_KHR_debug} extension \e{must} be available in the context     in order to access the messages logged by OpenGL. You can check the     presence of this extension by calling:      \code      ctx->hasExtension(QByteArrayLiteral("GL_KHR_debug"))      \endcode      where \c{ctx} is a valid QOpenGLContext. If the extension is not available,     initialize() will return false.      \section1 Reading the internal OpenGL debug log      OpenGL implementations keep an internal log of debug messages. Messages     stored in this log can be retrieved by using the loggedMessages() function:      \code      QList<QOpenGLDebugMessage> messages = logger->loggedMessages();     foreach (const QOpenGLDebugMessage&message, messages)         qDebug()<< message;      \endcode      The internal log has a limited size; when it fills up, older messages will     get discarded to make room for the new incoming messages. When you call     loggedMessages(), the internal log will be emptied as well.      If you want to be sure not to lose any debug message, you must use real-time     logging instead of calling this function. However, debug messages might     still be generated in the timespan between context creation and activation     of real-time logging (or, in general, when the real-time logging is disabled).      \section1 Real-time logging of messages      It is also possible to receive a stream of debug messages from the OpenGL     server \e{as they are generated} by the implementation. In order to do so,     you need to connect a suitable slot to the messageLogged() signal, and     start logging by calling startLogging():      \code      connect(logger,&QOpenGLDebugLogger::messageLogged, receiver,&LogHandler::handleLoggedMessage);     logger->startLogging();      \endcode      Similarly, logging can be disabled at any time by calling the stopLogging()     function.      Real-time logging can be either asynchronous or synchronous, depending on     the parameter passed to startLogging(). When logging in asynchronous mode     (the default, as it has a very small overhead), the OpenGL implementation     can generate messages at any time, and/or in an order which is different from the     order of the OpenGL commands which caused those messages to be logged.     The messages could also be generated from a thread that it's different from     the thread the context is currently bound to. This is because OpenGL     implementations are usually highly threaded and asynchronous, and therefore     no warranties are made about the relative order and the timings of the     debug messages.      On the other hand, logging in synchronous mode has a high overhead, but     the OpenGL implementation guarantees that all the messages caused by a     certain command are received in order, before the command returns,     and from the same thread the OpenGL context is bound to.      This means that when logging in synchronous mode you will be able to run     your OpenGL application in a debugger, put a breakpoint on a slot connected     to the messageLogged() signal, and see in the backtrace the exact call     that caused the logged message. This can be extremely useful to debug     an OpenGL problem. Note that if OpenGL rendering is happening in another     thread, you must force the signal/slot connection type to Qt::DirectConnection     in order to be able to see the actual backtrace.      Refer to the LoggingMode enum documentation for more information about     logging modes.      \note When real-time logging is enabled, debug messages will \e{not} be     inserted in the internal OpenGL debug log any more; messages already     present in the internal log will not be deleted, nor they will be emitted     through the messageLogged() signal. Since some messages might be generated     before real-time logging is started (and therefore be kept in the internal     OpenGL log), it is important to always check if it contains any message     after calling startLogging().      \section1 Inserting messages in the debug log      It is possible for applications and libraries to insert custom messages in     the debug log, for instance for marking a group of related OpenGL commands     and therefore being then able to identify eventual messages coming from them.      In order to do so, you can create a QOpenGLDebugMessage object by calling     \l{QOpenGLDebugMessage::}{createApplicationMessage()} or     \l{QOpenGLDebugMessage::}{createThirdPartyMessage()}, and then inserting it     into the log by calling logMessage():      \code      QOpenGLDebugMessage message =         QOpenGLDebugMessage::createApplicationMessage(QStringLiteral("Custom message"));      logger->logMessage(message);      \endcode      Note that OpenGL implementations have a vendor-specific limit to the length     of the messages that can be inserted in the debug log. You can retrieve     this length by calling the maximumMessageLength() method; messages longer     than the limit will automatically get truncated.      \section1 Controlling the debug output      QOpenGLDebugMessage is also able to apply filters to the debug messages, and     therefore limit the amount of messages logged. You can enable or disable     logging of messages by calling enableMessages() and disableMessages()     respectively. By default, all messages are logged.      It is possible to enable or disable messages by selecting them by:      \list     \li source, type and severity (and including all ids in the selection);     \li id, source and type (and including all severities in the selection).     \endlist      Note that the "enabled" status for a given message is a property of the     (id, source, type, severity) tuple; the message attributes \e{do not} form     a hierarchy of any kind. You should be careful about the order of the calls     to enableMessages() and disableMessages(), as it will change which     messages will are enabled / disabled.      It's not possible to filter by the message text itself; applications     have to do that on their own (in slots connected to the messageLogged()     signal, or after fetching the messages in the internal debug log     through loggedMessages()).      In order to simplify the management of the enabled / disabled statuses,     QOpenGLDebugMessage also supports the concept of \c{debug groups}. A debug     group contains the group of enabled / disabled configurations of debug     messages. Moreover, debug groups are organized in a stack: it is possible     to push and pop groups by calling pushGroup() and popGroup() respectively.     (When an OpenGL context is created, there is already a group in the stack).      The enableMessages() and disableMessages() functions will modify the     configuration in the current debug group, that is, the one at the top of     the debug groups stack.      When a new group is pushed onto the debug groups stack, it will inherit     the configuration of the group that was previously on the top of the stack.     Vice versa, popping a debug group will restore the configuration of     the debug group that becomes the new top.      Pushing (respectively popping) debug groups will also automatically generate     a debug message of type QOpenGLDebugMessage::GroupPushType (respectively     \l{QOpenGLDebugMessage::}{GroupPopType}).      \sa QOpenGLDebugMessage */

This means         that messages can be logged some time after the corresponding OpenGL         actions that caused them, and even be received in an out-of-order         fashion, depending on the OpenGL implementation. This mode has a very low         performance penalty, as OpenGL implementations are heavily threaded         and asynchronous by nature.      \value SynchronousLogging         Messages from the OpenGL server are logged synchronously and         sequentially. This has a severe performance hit, as OpenGL         implementations are very asynchronous by nature; but it's very useful         to debug OpenGL problems, as OpenGL guarantees that the messages         generated by a OpenGL command will be logged before the corresponding         command execution has returned.

QOpenGLDebugLogger will record the values of \c{GL_DEBUG_OUTPUT} and     \c{GL_DEBUG_OUTPUT_SYNCHRONOUS} when logging is started, and set them back     when logging is stopped.

comment|/*!     \fn void QOpenGLDebugLogger::messageLogged(const QOpenGLDebugMessage&debugMessage)      This signal is emitted when a debug message (wrapped by the \a debugMessage     argument) is logged from the OpenGL server.      Depending on the OpenGL implementation, this signal can be emitted     from other threads than the one(s) the receiver(s) lives in, and even     different from the thread the QOpenGLContext in which this object has     been initialized lives in. Moreover, the signal could be emitted from     multiple threads at the same time. This is normally not a problem,     as Qt will utilize a queued connection for cross-thread signal emissions,     but if you force the connection type to Direct then you must be aware of     the potential races in the slots connected to this signal.      If logging have been started in SynchronousLogging mode, OpenGL guarantees     that this signal will be emitted from the same thread the QOpenGLContext     has been bound to, and no concurrent invocations will ever happen.      \note Logging must have been started, or this signal will not be emitted.      \sa startLogging() */

This is also the maximum length of a debug group     name, as pushing or popping groups will automatically log a message with     the debug group name as the message text.      If a message text is too long, it will be automatically truncated by     QOpenGLDebugLogger.      \note Message texts are encoded in UTF-8 when they get passed to OpenGL, so     their size in bytes does not usually match the amount of UTF-16 code units,     as returned f.i. by QString::length(). (It does if the message contains     7-bit ASCII only data, which is typical for debug messages.) */
