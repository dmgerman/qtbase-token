A mouse plugin can be created by subclassing     QGenericPlugin and reimplementing the pure virtual create()     function. By exporting the derived class using the     Q_PLUGIN_METADATA() macro, The default implementation of the     QGenericPluginFactory class will automatically detect the plugin and     load the driver into the server application at run-time. See \l     {How to Create Qt Plugins} for details.      The json metadata file should contain a list of keys supported by this     plugin.      \sa QGenericPluginFactory */
