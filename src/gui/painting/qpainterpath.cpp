comment|/*!     \class QPainterPath     \ingroup painting     \ingroup shared     \inmodule QtGui      \brief The QPainterPath class provides a container for painting operations,     enabling graphical shapes to be constructed and reused.      A painter path is an object composed of a number of graphical     building blocks, such as rectangles, ellipses, lines, and curves.     Building blocks can be joined in closed subpaths, for example as a     rectangle or an ellipse. A closed path has coinciding start and     end points. Or they can exist independently as unclosed subpaths,     such as lines and curves.      A QPainterPath object can be used for filling, outlining, and     clipping. To generate fillable outlines for a given painter path,     use the QPainterPathStroker class.  The main advantage of painter     paths over normal drawing operations is that complex shapes only     need to be created once; then they can be drawn many times using     only calls to the QPainter::drawPath() function.      QPainterPath provides a collection of functions that can be used     to obtain information about the path and its elements. In addition     it is possible to reverse the order of the elements using the     toReversed() function. There are also several functions to convert     this painter path object into a polygon representation.      \tableofcontents      \section1 Composing a QPainterPath      A QPainterPath object can be constructed as an empty path, with a     given start point, or as a copy of another QPainterPath object.     Once created, lines and curves can be added to the path using the     lineTo(), arcTo(), cubicTo() and quadTo() functions. The lines and     curves stretch from the currentPosition() to the position passed     as argument.      The currentPosition() of the QPainterPath object is always the end     position of the last subpath that was added (or the initial start     point). Use the moveTo() function to move the currentPosition()     without adding a component. The moveTo() function implicitly     starts a new subpath, and closes the previous one.  Another way of     starting a new subpath is to call the closeSubpath() function     which closes the current path by adding a line from the     currentPosition() back to the path's start position. Note that the     new path will have (0, 0) as its initial currentPosition().      QPainterPath class also provides several convenience functions to     add closed subpaths to a painter path: addEllipse(), addPath(),     addRect(), addRegion() and addText(). The addPolygon() function     adds an \e unclosed subpath. In fact, these functions are all     collections of moveTo(), lineTo() and cubicTo() operations.      In addition, a path can be added to the current path using the     connectPath() function. But note that this function will connect     the last element of the current path to the first element of given     one by adding a line.      Below is a code snippet that shows how a QPainterPath object can     be used:      \table 100%     \row     \li \inlineimage qpainterpath-construction.png     \li     \snippet code/src_gui_painting_qpainterpath.cpp 0     \endtable      The painter path is initially empty when constructed. We first add     a rectangle, which is a closed subpath. Then we add two bezier     curves which together form a closed subpath even though they are     not closed individually. Finally we draw the entire path. The path     is filled using the default fill rule, Qt::OddEvenFill. Qt     provides two methods for filling paths:      \table     \header     \li Qt::OddEvenFill     \li Qt::WindingFill     \row     \li \inlineimage qt-fillrule-oddeven.png     \li \inlineimage qt-fillrule-winding.png     \endtable      See the Qt::FillRule documentation for the definition of the     rules. A painter path's currently set fill rule can be retrieved     using the fillRule() function, and altered using the setFillRule()     function.      \section1 QPainterPath Information      The QPainterPath class provides a collection of functions that     returns information about the path and its elements.      The currentPosition() function returns the end point of the last     subpath that was added (or the initial start point). The     elementAt() function can be used to retrieve the various subpath     elements, the \e number of elements can be retrieved using the     elementCount() function, and the isEmpty() function tells whether     this QPainterPath object contains any elements at all.      The controlPointRect() function returns the rectangle containing     all the points and control points in this path. This function is     significantly faster to compute than the exact boundingRect()     which returns the bounding rectangle of this painter path with     floating point precision.      Finally, QPainterPath provides the contains() function which can     be used to determine whether a given point or rectangle is inside     the path, and the intersects() function which determines if any of     the points inside a given rectangle also are inside this path.      \section1 QPainterPath Conversion      For compatibility reasons, it might be required to simplify the     representation of a painter path: QPainterPath provides the     toFillPolygon(), toFillPolygons() and toSubpathPolygons()     functions which convert the painter path into a polygon. The     toFillPolygon() returns the painter path as one single polygon,     while the two latter functions return a list of polygons.      The toFillPolygons() and toSubpathPolygons() functions are     provided because it is usually faster to draw several small     polygons than to draw one large polygon, even though the total     number of points drawn is the same. The difference between the two     is the \e number of polygons they return: The toSubpathPolygons()     creates one polygon for each subpath regardless of intersecting     subpaths (i.e. overlapping bounding rectangles), while the     toFillPolygons() functions creates only one polygon for     overlapping subpaths.      The toFillPolygon() and toFillPolygons() functions first convert     all the subpaths to polygons, then uses a rewinding technique to     make sure that overlapping subpaths can be filled using the     correct fill rule. Note that rewinding inserts additional lines in     the polygon so the outline of the fill polygon does not match the     outline of the path.      \section1 Examples      Qt provides the \l {painting/painterpaths}{Painter Paths Example}     and the \l {painting/deform}{Vector Deformation example} which are     located in Qt's example directory.      The \l {painting/painterpaths}{Painter Paths Example} shows how     painter paths can be used to build complex shapes for rendering     and lets the user experiment with the filling and stroking.  The     \l {painting/deform}{Vector Deformation Example} shows how to use     QPainterPath to draw text.      \table     \header     \li \l {painting/painterpaths}{Painter Paths Example}     \li \l {painting/deform}{Vector Deformation Example}     \row     \li \inlineimage qpainterpath-example.png     \li \inlineimage qpainterpath-demo.png     \endtable      \sa QPainterPathStroker, QPainter, QRegion, {Painter Paths Example} */

comment|/*!     Converts the path into a list of polygons using the     QTransform \a matrix, and returns the list.      The function differs from the toFillPolygon() function in that it     creates several polygons. It is provided because it is usually     faster to draw several small polygons than to draw one large     polygon, even though the total number of points drawn is the same.      The toFillPolygons() function differs from the toSubpathPolygons()     function in that it create only polygon for subpaths that have     overlapping bounding rectangles.      Like the toFillPolygon() function, this function uses a rewinding     technique to make sure that overlapping subpaths can be filled     using the correct fill rule. Note that rewinding inserts addition     lines in the polygons so the outline of the fill polygon does not     match the outline of the path.      \sa toSubpathPolygons(), toFillPolygon(),     {QPainterPath#QPainterPath Conversion}{QPainterPath Conversion} */

comment|/*!     \since 4.1     \class QPainterPathStroker     \ingroup painting     \inmodule QtGui      \brief The QPainterPathStroker class is used to generate fillable     outlines for a given painter path.      By calling the createStroke() function, passing a given     QPainterPath as argument, a new painter path representing the     outline of the given path is created. The newly created painter     path can then be filled to draw the original painter path's     outline.      You can control the various design aspects (width, cap styles,     join styles and dash pattern) of the outlining using the following     functions:      \list     \li setWidth()     \li setCapStyle()     \li setJoinStyle()     \li setDashPattern()     \endlist      The setDashPattern() function accepts both a Qt::PenStyle object     and a vector representation of the pattern as argument.      In addition you can specify a curve's threshold, controlling the     granularity with which a curve is drawn, using the     setCurveThreshold() function. The default threshold is a well     adjusted value (0.25), and normally you should not need to modify     it. However, you can make the curve's appearance smoother by     decreasing its value.      You can also control the miter limit for the generated outline     using the setMiterLimit() function. The miter limit describes how     far from each join the miter join can extend. The limit is     specified in the units of width so the pixelwise miter limit will     be \c {miterlimit * width}. This value is only used if the join     style is Qt::MiterJoin.      The painter path generated by the createStroke() function should     only be used for outlining the given painter path. Otherwise it     may cause unexpected behavior. Generated outlines also require the     Qt::WindingFill rule which is set by default.      \sa QPen, QBrush */
