comment|/*!     \class QSqlDriverPlugin     \brief The QSqlDriverPlugin class provides an abstract base for custom QSqlDriver plugins.      \ingroup plugins     \inmodule QtSql      The SQL driver plugin is a simple plugin interface that makes it     easy to create your own SQL driver plugins that can be loaded     dynamically by Qt.      Writing a SQL plugin is achieved by subclassing this base class,     reimplementing the pure virtual function create(), and     exporting the class with the Q_PLUGIN_METADATA() macro. See the SQL     plugins that come with Qt for example implementations (in the     \c{plugins/src/sqldrivers} subdirectory of the source     distribution).      The json file containing the metadata for the plugin contains a list of     keys indicating the supported sql drivers      \code     { "Keys": [ "mysqldriver" ] }     \endcode      \sa {How to Create Qt Plugins} */
