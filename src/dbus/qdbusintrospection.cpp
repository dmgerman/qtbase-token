comment|/*!     \class QDBusIntrospection     \brief Information about introspected objects and interfaces on D-Bus.     \internal      This class provides structures and methods for parsing the XML introspection data for D-Bus.     Normally, you don't have to use the methods provided here: QDBusInterface and QDBusObject will     do that for you.      But they may prove useful if the XML data was obtained through other means (like parsing a file). */
comment|/*!     \class QDBusIntrospection::Argument     \brief One argument to a D-Bus method or signal.      This struct represents one argument passed to a method or received from a method or signal in     D-Bus. The struct does not contain information on the direction (input or output). */
comment|/*!     \variable QDBusIntrospection::Argument::type     The argument type. */

comment|/*!     \class QDBusIntrospection::Method     \brief Information about one method.      This struct represents one method discovered through introspection. A method is composed of     its \a name, its input arguments, its output arguments, and, optionally, annotations. There are no     "in-out" arguments. */

comment|/*!     \variable QDBusIntrospection::Property::name     The property's name. */

comment|/*!     \class QDBusIntrospection::Interface     \brief Information about one interface on the bus.      Each interface on D-Bus has an unique \a name, identifying where that interface was defined.     Interfaces may have annotations, methods, signals and properties, but none are mandatory. */
comment|/*!     \variable QDBusIntrospection::Interface::name     The interface's name. */
comment|/*!     \variable QDBusIntrospection::Interface::introspection     The XML document fragment describing this interface.      If parsed again through parseInterface, the object returned should have the same contents as     this object. */

comment|/*!     \variable QDBusIntrospection::Interface::signals_     The signals available in this interface. Note that signal names are not unique (i.e., signals     can be overloaded with multiple argument types).      This member is called "signals_" because "signals" is a reserved keyword in Qt. */

comment|/*!     \class QDBusIntrospection::Object     \brief Information about one object on the bus.      An object on the D-Bus bus is represented by its service and path on the service but, unlike     interfaces, objects are mutable. That is, their contents can change with time. Therefore,     while the (service, path) pair uniquely identifies an object, the information contained in     this struct may no longer represent the object.      An object can contain interfaces and child (sub) objects. */

comment|/*!     \variable QDBusIntrospection::Object::introspection     The XML document fragment describing this object, its interfaces and sub-objects at the time     of the parsing.      The result of parseObject with this XML data should be the same as the Object struct. */
comment|/*!     \variable QDBusIntrospection::Object::interfaces     The list of interface names in this object. */
comment|/*!     \variable QDBusIntrospection::Object::childObjects     The list of child object names in this object. Note that this is a relative name, not an     absolute path. To obtain the absolute path, concatenate with \l     {QDBusIntrospection::Object::path}{path}. */
comment|/*!     \class QDBusIntrospection::ObjectTree     \brief Complete information about one object node and its descendency.          This struct contains the same data as QDBusIntrospection::Object, plus the actual data for the     interfaces and child (sub) objects that was available in the XML document. */
comment|/*!     \variable QDBusIntrospection::ObjectTree::interfaceData     A map of interfaces and their names. */
comment|/*!     \variable QDBusIntrospection::ObjectTree::childObjectData     A map of object paths and their data. The map key contains the relative path to the object.      Note this map contains only the child notes that do have information about the sub-object's     contents. If the XML data did not contain the information, only the object name will be listed     in childObjects, but not in childObjectData. */
comment|/*!     \typedef QDBusIntrospection::Annotations     Contains a QMap of an annotation pair. The annotation's name is stored in the QMap key and     must be unique. The annotation's value is stored in the QMap's value and is arbitrary. */
