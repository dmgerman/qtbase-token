comment|/* When compiling a DLL for Windows, the exported symbols have to be declared using some MS magic. I found some useful information on this web page: http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y4h7bcy6(VS.80).aspx. According to the information there, using __declspec(dllexport) without "extern" we have a definition; with "extern" we have a declaration. The settings here override the setting in pcre.h (which is included below); it defines only PCRE_EXP_DECL, which is all that is needed for applications (they just import the symbols). We use:    PCRE_EXP_DECL       for declarations   PCRE_EXP_DEFN       for definitions of exported functions   PCRE_EXP_DATA_DEFN  for definitions of exported variables  The reason for the two DEFN macros is that in non-Windows environments, one does not want to have "extern" before variable definitions because it leads to compiler warnings. So we distinguish between functions and variables. In Windows, the two should always be the same.  The reason for wrapping this in #ifndef PCRE_EXP_DECL is so that pcretest, which is an application, but needs to import this file in order to "peek" at internals, can #include pcre.h first to get an application's-eye view.  In principle, people compiling for non-Windows, non-Unix-like (i.e. uncommon, special-purpose environments) might want to stick other stuff in front of exported symbols. That's why, in the non-Windows case, we set PCRE_EXP_DEFN and PCRE_EXP_DATA_DEFN only if they are not already set. */

comment|/* When compiling with the MSVC compiler, it is sometimes necessary to include a "calling convention" before exported function names. (This is secondhand information; I know nothing about MSVC myself). For example, something like    void __cdecl function(....)  might be needed. In order so make this easy, all the exported functions have PCRE_CALL_CONVENTION just before their names. It is rarely needed; if not set, we ensure here that it has no effect. */

We cannot determine these outside the compilation (e.g. by running a program as part of "configure") because PCRE is often cross-compiled for use on other systems. Instead we make use of the maximum sizes that are available at preprocessor time in standard C environments. */

Otherwise we have to cast to double, which of course requires floating point arithmetic. Handle this by defining a macro for the appropriate type. If stdint.h is available, include it; it may define INT64_MAX. Systems that do not have stdint.h (e.g. Solaris) may have inttypes.h. The macro int64_t may be set by "configure". */

comment|/* All character handling must be done as unsigned characters. Otherwise there are problems with top-bit-set characters and functions such as isspace(). However, we leave the interface to the outside world as char * or short *, because that should make things easier for callers. This character type is called pcre_uchar.  The IN_UCHARS macro multiply its argument with the byte size of the current pcre_uchar type. Useful for memcpy and such operations, whose require the byte size of their input/output buffers.  The MAX_255 macro checks whether its pcre_uchar input is less than 256.  The TABLE_GET macro is designed for accessing elements of tables whose contain exactly 256 items. When the character is able to contain more than 256 items, some check is needed before accessing these tables. */

This makes it possible, for example, to allow pcre_exec() to process subject strings that are discontinuous by using a smart pointer class. It must always be possible to inspect all of the subject string in pcre_exec() because of the way it backtracks. Two macros are required in the normal case, for sign-unspecified and unsigned char pointers. The former is used for the external interface and appears in pcre.h, which is why its name must begin with PCRE_. */

comment|/* PCRE keeps offsets in its compiled code as 2-byte quantities (always stored in big-endian order) by default. These are used, for example, to link from the start of a subpattern to its alternatives and its end. The use of 2 bytes per offset limits the size of the compiled regex to around 64K, which is big enough for almost everybody. However, I received a request for an even bigger limit. For this reason, and also to make the code easier to maintain, the storing and loading of offsets from the byte string is now handled by the macros that are defined here.  The macros are controlled by the value of LINK_SIZE. This defaults to 2 in the config.h file, but can be overridden by using -D on the command line. This is automated on Unix systems via the "configure" command. */

Using a switch statement for this generates the fastest code (no loop, no memory access), and there are several places in the interpreter code where this happens. In order to ensure that all the case lists remain in step, we use macros so that there is only one place where the lists are defined.  These values are also required as lists in pcre_compile.c when processing \h, \H, \v and \V in a character class. The lists are defined in pcre_tables.c, but macros that define the values are here so that all the definitions are together. The lists must be in ascending character order, terminated by NOTACHAR (which is 0xffffffff).  Any changes should ensure that the various macros are kept in step with each other. NOTE: The values also appear in pcre_jit_compile.c. */

comment|/* If PCRE is to support UTF-8 on EBCDIC platforms, we cannot use normal character constants like '*' because the compiler would emit their EBCDIC code, which is different from their ASCII/UTF-8 code. Instead we define macros for the characters so that they always use the ASCII/UTF-8 code when UTF-8 support is enabled. When UTF-8 support is not enabled, the definitions use character literals. Both character and string versions of each character are needed, and there are some longer strings as well.  This means that, on EBCDIC platforms, the PCRE library can handle either EBCDIC, or UTF-8, but not both. To support both in the same compiled library would need different lookups depending on whether PCRE_UTF8 was set or not. This would make it impossible to use characters in switch/case statements, which would reduce performance. For a theoretical use (which nobody has asked for) in a minority area (EBCDIC platforms), this is not sensible. Any application that did need both could compile two versions of the library, using macros to give the functions distinct names. */

Newline characters are problematic in EBCDIC. Though it has CR and LF characters, a common practice has been to use its NL (0x15) character as the line terminator in C-like processing environments. However, sometimes the LF (0x25) character is used instead, according to this Unicode document:  http://unicode.org/standard/reports/tr13/tr13-5.html  PCRE defaults EBCDIC NL to 0x15, but has a build-time option to select 0x25 instead. Whichever is *not* chosen is defined as NEL.  In both ASCII and EBCDIC environments, CHAR_NL and CHAR_LF are synonyms for the same code point. */

comment|/* These are escaped items that aren't just an encoding of a particular data value such as \n. They must have non-zero values, as check_escape() returns 0 for a data character.  Also, they must appear in the same order as in the opcode definitions below, up to ESC_z. There's a dummy for OP_ALLANY because it corresponds to "." in DOTALL mode rather than an escape sequence. It is also used for [^] in JavaScript compatibility mode, and for \C in non-utf mode. In non-DOTALL mode, "." behaves like \N.  The special values ESC_DU, ESC_du, etc. are used instead of ESC_D, ESC_d, etc. when PCRE_UCP is set and replacement of \d etc by \p sequences is required. They must be contiguous, and remain in order so that the replacements can be looked up from a table.  Negative numbers are used to encode a backreference (\1, \2, \3, etc.) in check_escape(). There are two tests in the code for an escape greater than ESC_b and less than ESC_Z to detect the types that may be repeated. These are the types that consume characters. If any new escapes are put in between that don't consume a character, that code will have to change. */

comment|/* This macro defines the length of fixed length operations in the compiled regex. The lengths are used when searching for specific things, and also in the debugging printing of a compiled regex. We use a macro so that it can be defined close to the definitions of the opcodes themselves.  As things have been extended, some of these are no longer fixed lenths, but are minima instead. For example, the length of a single-character repeat may vary in UTF-8 mode. The code that uses this table must know about such things. */

We store an explicit offset to the name table so that if a regex is compiled on one host, saved, and then run on another where the size of pointers is different, all might still be well. For the case of compiled-on-4 and run-on-8, we include an extra pointer that is always NULL. For future-proofing, a few dummy fields were originally included - even though you can never get this planning right - but there is only one left now.  NOTE NOTE NOTE: Because people can now save and re-use compiled patterns, any additions to this structure should be made at the end, and something earlier (e.g. a new flag in the options or one of the dummy fields) should indicate that the new fields are present. Currently PCRE always sets the dummy fields to zero. NOTE NOTE NOTE */
