comment|/* A problem turned up with PCRE_PRERELEASE, which is defined empty for production releases. Originally, it was used naively in this code:    return XSTRING(PCRE_MAJOR)          "." XSTRING(PCRE_MINOR)              XSTRING(PCRE_PRERELEASE)          " " XSTRING(PCRE_DATE);  However, when PCRE_PRERELEASE is empty, this leads to an attempted expansion of STRING(). The C standard states: "If (before argument substitution) any argument consists of no preprocessing tokens, the behavior is undefined." It turns out the gcc treats this case as a single empty string - which is what we really want - but Visual C grumbles about the lack of an argument for the macro. Unfortunately, both are within their rights. To cope with both ways of handling this, I had resort to some messy hackery that does a test at run time. I could find no way of detecting that a macro is defined as an empty string at pre-processor time. This hack uses a standard trick for avoiding calling the STRING macro with an empty argument when doing the test. */
