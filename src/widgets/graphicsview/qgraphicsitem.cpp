comment|/*!     \class QGraphicsItem     \brief The QGraphicsItem class is the base class for all graphical     items in a QGraphicsScene.     \since 4.2      \ingroup graphicsview-api     \inmodule QtWidgets      It provides a light-weight foundation for writing your own custom items.     This includes defining the item's geometry, collision detection, its     painting implementation and item interaction through its event handlers.     QGraphicsItem is part of the \l{Graphics View Framework}      \image graphicsview-items.png      For convenience, Qt provides a set of standard graphics items for the most     common shapes. These are:      \list     \li QGraphicsEllipseItem provides an ellipse item     \li QGraphicsLineItem provides a line item     \li QGraphicsPathItem provides an arbitrary path item     \li QGraphicsPixmapItem provides a pixmap item     \li QGraphicsPolygonItem provides a polygon item     \li QGraphicsRectItem provides a rectangular item     \li QGraphicsSimpleTextItem provides a simple text label item     \li QGraphicsTextItem provides an advanced text browser item     \endlist      All of an item's geometric information is based on its local coordinate     system. The item's position, pos(), is the only function that does not     operate in local coordinates, as it returns a position in parent     coordinates. \l {The Graphics View Coordinate System} describes the coordinate     system in detail.      You can set whether an item should be visible (i.e., drawn, and accepting     events), by calling setVisible(). Hiding an item will also hide its     children. Similarly, you can enable or disable an item by calling     setEnabled(). If you disable an item, all its children will also be     disabled. By default, items are both visible and enabled. To toggle     whether an item is selected or not, first enable selection by setting     the ItemIsSelectable flag, and then call setSelected(). Normally,     selection is toggled by the scene, as a result of user interaction.      To write your own graphics item, you first create a subclass of     QGraphicsItem, and then start by implementing its two pure virtual public     functions: boundingRect(), which returns an estimate of the area painted     by the item, and paint(), which implements the actual painting. For     example:      \snippet code/src_gui_graphicsview_qgraphicsitem.cpp 0      The boundingRect() function has many different purposes.     QGraphicsScene bases its item index on boundingRect(), and     QGraphicsView uses it both for culling invisible items, and for     determining the area that needs to be recomposed when drawing     overlapping items. In addition, QGraphicsItem's collision     detection mechanisms use boundingRect() to provide an efficient     cut-off. The fine grained collision algorithm in     collidesWithItem() is based on calling shape(), which returns an     accurate outline of the item's shape as a QPainterPath.      QGraphicsScene expects all items boundingRect() and shape() to     remain unchanged unless it is notified. If you want to change an     item's geometry in any way, you must first call     prepareGeometryChange() to allow QGraphicsScene to update its     bookkeeping.      Collision detection can be done in two ways:      \list 1      \li Reimplement shape() to return an accurate shape for your item,     and rely on the default implementation of collidesWithItem() to do     shape-shape intersection. This can be rather expensive if the     shapes are complex.      \li Reimplement collidesWithItem() to provide your own custom item     and shape collision algorithm.      \endlist      The contains() function can be called to determine whether the item \e     contains a point or not. This function can also be reimplemented by the     item. The default behavior of contains() is based on calling shape().      Items can contain other items, and also be contained by other items. All     items can have a parent item and a list of children. Unless the item has     no parent, its position is in \e parent coordinates (i.e., the parent's     local coordinates). Parent items propagate both their position and their     transformation to all children.      \image graphicsview-parentchild.png      \target Transformations     \section1 Transformations      QGraphicsItem supports projective transformations in addition to its base     position, pos(). There are several ways to change an item's transformation.     For simple transformations, you can call either of the convenience     functions setRotation() or setScale(), or you can pass any transformation     matrix to setTransform(). For advanced transformation control you also have     the option of setting several combined transformations by calling     setTransformations().      Item transformations accumulate from parent to child, so if both a parent     and child item are rotated 90 degrees, the child's total transformation     will be 180 degrees. Similarly, if the item's parent is scaled to 2x its     original size, its children will also be twice as large. An item's     transformation does not affect its own local geometry; all geometry     functions (e.g., contains(), update(), and all the mapping functions) still     operate in local coordinates. For convenience, QGraphicsItem provides the     functions sceneTransform(), which returns the item's total transformation     matrix (including its position and all parents' positions and     transformations), and scenePos(), which returns its position in scene     coordinates. To reset an item's matrix, call resetTransform().      Certain transformation operations produce a different outcome depending on     the order in which they are applied. For example, if you scale an     transform, and then rotate it, you may get a different result than if the     transform was rotated first. However, the order you set the transformation     properties on QGraphicsItem does not affect the resulting transformation;     QGraphicsItem always applies the properties in a fixed, defined order:      \list     \li The item's base transform is applied (transform())     \li The item's transformations list is applied in order (transformations())     \li The item is rotated relative to its transform origin point (rotation(), transformOriginPoint())     \li The item is scaled relative to its transform origin point (scale(), transformOriginPoint())     \endlist      \section1 Painting      The paint() function is called by QGraphicsView to paint the item's     contents. The item has no background or default fill of its own; whatever     is behind the item will shine through all areas that are not explicitly     painted in this function.  You can call update() to schedule a repaint,     optionally passing the rectangle that needs a repaint. Depending on     whether or not the item is visible in a view, the item may or may not be     repainted; there is no equivalent to QWidget::repaint() in QGraphicsItem.      Items are painted by the view, starting with the parent items and then     drawing children, in ascending stacking order. You can set an item's     stacking order by calling setZValue(), and test it by calling     zValue(), where items with low z-values are painted before items with     high z-values. Stacking order applies to sibling items; parents are always     drawn before their children.      \section1 Sorting      All items are drawn in a defined, stable order, and this same order decides     which items will receive mouse input first when you click on the scene.     Normally you don't have to worry about sorting, as the items follow a     "natural order", following the logical structure of the scene.      An item's children are stacked on top of the parent, and sibling items are     stacked by insertion order (i.e., in the same order that they were either     added to the scene, or added to the same parent). If you add item A, and     then B, then B will be on top of A. If you then add C, the items' stacking     order will be A, then B, then C.      \image graphicsview-zorder.png      This example shows the stacking order of all limbs of the robot from the     \l{graphicsview/dragdroprobot}{Drag and Drop Robot} example. The torso is     the root item (all other items are children or descendants of the torso),     so it is drawn first. Next, the head is drawn, as it is the first item in     the torso's list of children. Then the upper left arm is drawn. As the     lower arm is a child of the upper arm, the lower arm is then drawn,     followed by the upper arm's next sibling, which is the upper right arm, and     so on.      For advanced users, there are ways to alter how your items are sorted:      \list     \li You can call setZValue() on an item to explicitly stack it on top of, or     under, other sibling items. The default Z value for an item is 0. Items     with the same Z value are stacked by insertion order.      \li You can call stackBefore() to reorder the list of children. This will     directly modify the insertion order.      \li You can set the ItemStacksBehindParent flag to stack a child item behind     its parent.     \endlist      The stacking order of two sibling items also counts for each item's     children and descendant items. So if one item is on top of another, then     all its children will also be on top of all the other item's children as     well.      \section1 Events      QGraphicsItem receives events from QGraphicsScene through the virtual     function sceneEvent(). This function distributes the most common events     to a set of convenience event handlers:      \list     \li contextMenuEvent() handles context menu events     \li focusInEvent() and focusOutEvent() handle focus in and out events     \li hoverEnterEvent(), hoverMoveEvent(), and hoverLeaveEvent() handles     hover enter, move and leave events     \li inputMethodEvent() handles input events, for accessibility support     \li keyPressEvent() and keyReleaseEvent() handle key press and release events     \li mousePressEvent(), mouseMoveEvent(), mouseReleaseEvent(), and     mouseDoubleClickEvent() handles mouse press, move, release, click and     doubleclick events     \endlist      You can filter events for any other item by installing event filters. This     functionality is separate from Qt's regular event filters (see     QObject::installEventFilter()), which only work on subclasses of QObject. After     installing your item as an event filter for another item by calling     installSceneEventFilter(), the filtered events will be received by the virtual     function sceneEventFilter(). You can remove item event filters by calling     removeSceneEventFilter().      \section1 Custom Data      Sometimes it's useful to register custom data with an item, be it a custom     item, or a standard item. You can call setData() on any item to store data     in it using a key-value pair (the key being an integer, and the value is a     QVariant). To get custom data from an item, call data(). This     functionality is completely untouched by Qt itself; it is provided for the     user's convenience.      \sa QGraphicsScene, QGraphicsView, {Graphics View Framework} */

comment|/*!     \enum QGraphicsItem::GraphicsItemFlag      This enum describes different flags that you can set on an item to     toggle different features in the item's behavior.      All flags are disabled by default.      \value ItemIsMovable The item supports interactive movement using     the mouse. By clicking on the item and then dragging, the item     will move together with the mouse cursor. If the item has     children, all children are also moved. If the item is part of a     selection, all selected items are also moved. This feature is     provided as a convenience through the base implementation of     QGraphicsItem's mouse event handlers.      \value ItemIsSelectable The item supports selection. Enabling this     feature will enable setSelected() to toggle selection for the     item. It will also let the item be selected automatically as a     result of calling QGraphicsScene::setSelectionArea(), by clicking     on an item, or by using rubber band selection in QGraphicsView.      \value ItemIsFocusable The item supports keyboard input focus (i.e., it is     an input item). Enabling this flag will allow the item to accept focus,     which again allows the delivery of key events to     QGraphicsItem::keyPressEvent() and QGraphicsItem::keyReleaseEvent().      \value ItemClipsToShape The item clips to its own shape. The item cannot     draw or receive mouse, tablet, drag and drop or hover events outside its     shape. It is disabled by default. This behavior is enforced by     QGraphicsView::drawItems() or QGraphicsScene::drawItems(). This flag was     introduced in Qt 4.3.      \value ItemClipsChildrenToShape The item clips the painting of all its     descendants to its own shape. Items that are either direct or indirect     children of this item cannot draw outside this item's shape. By default,     this flag is disabled; children can draw anywhere. This behavior is     enforced by QGraphicsView::drawItems() or     QGraphicsScene::drawItems(). This flag was introduced in Qt 4.3.      \value ItemIgnoresTransformations The item ignores inherited     transformations (i.e., its position is still anchored to its parent, but     the parent or view rotation, zoom or shear transformations are ignored).     This flag is useful for keeping text label items horizontal and unscaled,     so they will still be readable if the view is transformed.  When set, the     item's view geometry and scene geometry will be maintained separately. You     must call deviceTransform() to map coordinates and detect collisions in     the view. By default, this flag is disabled. This flag was introduced in     Qt 4.3. \note With this flag set you can still scale the item itself, and     that scale transformation will influence the item's children.      \value ItemIgnoresParentOpacity The item ignores its parent's opacity. The     item's effective opacity is the same as its own; it does not combine with     the parent's opacity. This flags allows your item to keep its absolute     opacity even if the parent is semitransparent. This flag was introduced in     Qt 4.5.      \value ItemDoesntPropagateOpacityToChildren The item doesn't propagate its     opacity to its children. This flag allows you to create a semitransparent     item that does not affect the opacity of its children. This flag was     introduced in Qt 4.5.      \value ItemStacksBehindParent The item is stacked behind its parent. By     default, child items are stacked on top of the parent item. But setting     this flag, the child will be stacked behind it. This flag is useful for     drop shadow effects and for decoration objects that follow the parent     item's geometry without drawing on top of it. This flag was introduced     in Qt 4.5.      \value ItemUsesExtendedStyleOption The item makes use of either     \l{QStyleOptionGraphicsItem::} {exposedRect} or     \l{QStyleOptionGraphicsItem::} {matrix} in     QStyleOptionGraphicsItem. By default, the     \l{QStyleOptionGraphicsItem::} {exposedRect} is initialized to the     item's boundingRect() and the     \l{QStyleOptionGraphicsItem::}{matrix} is untransformed.  You can     enable this flag for the style options to be set up with more     fine-grained values.  Note that     QStyleOptionGraphicsItem::levelOfDetail is unaffected by this flag     and always initialized to 1. Use     QStyleOptionGraphicsItem::levelOfDetailFromTransform() if you need     a higher value. This flag was introduced in Qt 4.6.      \value ItemHasNoContents The item does not paint anything (i.e., calling     paint() on the item has no effect). You should set this flag on items that     do not need to be painted to ensure that Graphics View avoids unnecessary     painting preparations. This flag was introduced in Qt 4.6.      \value ItemSendsGeometryChanges The item enables itemChange()     notifications for ItemPositionChange, ItemPositionHasChanged,     ItemMatrixChange, ItemTransformChange, ItemTransformHasChanged,     ItemRotationChange, ItemRotationHasChanged, ItemScaleChange, ItemScaleHasChanged,     ItemTransformOriginPointChange, and ItemTransformOriginPointHasChanged. For     performance reasons, these notifications are disabled by default. You must     enable this flag to receive notifications for position and transform     changes. This flag was introduced in Qt 4.6.      \value ItemAcceptsInputMethod The item supports input methods typically     used for Asian languages.     This flag was introduced in Qt 4.6.      \value ItemNegativeZStacksBehindParent The item automatically     stacks behind it's parent if it's z-value is negative. This flag     enables setZValue() to toggle ItemStacksBehindParent. This flag     was introduced in Qt 4.6.      \value ItemIsPanel The item is a panel. A panel provides activation and     contained focus handling. Only one panel can be active at a time (see     QGraphicsItem::isActive()). When no panel is active, QGraphicsScene     activates all non-panel items. Window items (i.e.,     QGraphicsItem::isWindow() returns true) are panels. This flag was     introduced in Qt 4.6.      \omitvalue ItemIsFocusScope \omit Internal only (for now). \endomit      \value ItemSendsScenePositionChanges The item enables itemChange()     notifications for ItemScenePositionHasChanged. For performance reasons,     these notifications are disabled by default. You must enable this flag     to receive notifications for scene position changes. This flag was     introduced in Qt 4.6.      \omitvalue ItemStopsClickFocusPropagation \omit The item stops propagating     click focus to items underneath when being clicked on. This flag     allows you create a non-focusable item that can be clicked on without     changing the focus. \endomit      \omitvalue ItemStopsFocusHandling \omit Same as     ItemStopsClickFocusPropagation, but also suppresses focus-out. This flag     allows you to completely take over focus handling.     This flag was introduced in Qt 4.7. \endomit */

comment|/*!     \enum QGraphicsItem::GraphicsItemChange      This enum describes the state changes that are notified by     QGraphicsItem::itemChange(). The notifications are sent as the state     changes, and in some cases, adjustments can be made (see the documentation     for each change for details).      Note: Be careful with calling functions on the QGraphicsItem itself inside     itemChange(), as certain function calls can lead to unwanted     recursion. For example, you cannot call setPos() in itemChange() on an     ItemPositionChange notification, as the setPos() function will again call     itemChange(ItemPositionChange). Instead, you can return the new, adjusted     position from itemChange().      \value ItemEnabledChange The item's enabled state changes. If the item is     presently enabled, it will become disabled, and vice verca. The value     argument is the new enabled state (i.e., true or false). Do not call     setEnabled() in itemChange() as this notification is delivered. Instead,     you can return the new state from itemChange().      \value ItemEnabledHasChanged The item's enabled state has changed. The     value argument is the new enabled state (i.e., true or false). Do not call     setEnabled() in itemChange() as this notification is delivered. The return     value is ignored.      \value ItemMatrixChange The item's affine transformation matrix is     changing. This value is obsolete; you can use ItemTransformChange instead.      \value ItemPositionChange The item's position changes. This notification     is sent if the ItemSendsGeometryChanges flag is enabled, and when the     item's local position changes, relative to its parent (i.e., as a result     of calling setPos() or moveBy()). The value argument is the new position     (i.e., a QPointF).  You can call pos() to get the original position. Do     not call setPos() or moveBy() in itemChange() as this notification is     delivered; instead, you can return the new, adjusted position from     itemChange(). After this notification, QGraphicsItem immediately sends the     ItemPositionHasChanged notification if the position changed.      \value ItemPositionHasChanged The item's position has changed. This     notification is sent if the ItemSendsGeometryChanges flag is enabled, and     after the item's local position, relative to its parent, has changed. The     value argument is the new position (the same as pos()), and QGraphicsItem     ignores the return value for this notification (i.e., a read-only     notification).      \value ItemTransformChange The item's transformation matrix changes. This     notification is send if the ItemSendsGeometryChanges flag is enabled, and     when the item's local transformation matrix changes (i.e., as a result of     calling setTransform(). The value argument is the new matrix (i.e., a     QTransform); to get the old matrix, call transform(). Do not call     setTransform() or set any of the transformation properties in itemChange()     as this notification is delivered; instead, you can return the new matrix     from itemChange().  This notification is not sent if you change the     transformation properties.      \value ItemTransformHasChanged The item's transformation matrix has     changed either because setTransform is called, or one of the     transformation properties is changed. This notification is sent if the     ItemSendsGeometryChanges flag is enabled, and after the item's local     transformation matrix has changed. The value argument is the new matrix     (same as transform()), and QGraphicsItem ignores the return value for this     notification (i.e., a read-only notification).      \value ItemRotationChange The item's rotation property changes. This     notification is sent if the ItemSendsGeometryChanges flag is enabled, and     when the item's rotation property changes (i.e., as a result of calling     setRotation()). The value argument is the new rotation (i.e., a double);     to get the old rotation, call rotation(). Do not call setRotation() in     itemChange() as this notification is delivered; instead, you can return     the new rotation from itemChange().      \value ItemRotationHasChanged The item's rotation property has changed.     This notification is sent if the ItemSendsGeometryChanges flag is enabled,     and after the item's rotation property has changed. The value argument is     the new rotation (i.e., a double), and QGraphicsItem ignores the return     value for this notification (i.e., a read-only notification). Do not call     setRotation() in itemChange() as this notification is delivered.      \value ItemScaleChange The item's scale property changes. This notification     is sent if the ItemSendsGeometryChanges flag is enabled, and when the item's     scale property changes (i.e., as a result of calling setScale()). The value     argument is the new scale (i.e., a double); to get the old scale, call     scale(). Do not call setScale() in itemChange() as this notification is     delivered; instead, you can return the new scale from itemChange().      \value ItemScaleHasChanged The item's scale property has changed. This     notification is sent if the ItemSendsGeometryChanges flag is enabled, and     after the item's scale property has changed. The value argument is the new     scale (i.e., a double), and QGraphicsItem ignores the return value for this     notification (i.e., a read-only notification). Do not call setScale() in     itemChange() as this notification is delivered.      \value ItemTransformOriginPointChange The item's transform origin point     property changes. This notification is sent if the ItemSendsGeometryChanges     flag is enabled, and when the item's transform origin point property changes     (i.e., as a result of calling setTransformOriginPoint()). The value argument     is the new origin point (i.e., a QPointF); to get the old origin point, call     transformOriginPoint(). Do not call setTransformOriginPoint() in itemChange()     as this notification is delivered; instead, you can return the new transform     origin point from itemChange().      \value ItemTransformOriginPointHasChanged The item's transform origin point     property has changed. This notification is sent if the ItemSendsGeometryChanges     flag is enabled, and after the item's transform origin point property has     changed. The value argument is the new origin point (i.e., a QPointF), and     QGraphicsItem ignores the return value for this notification (i.e., a read-only     notification). Do not call setTransformOriginPoint() in itemChange() as this     notification is delivered.      \value ItemSelectedChange The item's selected state changes. If the item is     presently selected, it will become unselected, and vice verca. The value     argument is the new selected state (i.e., true or false). Do not call     setSelected() in itemChange() as this notification is delivered; instead, you     can return the new selected state from itemChange().      \value ItemSelectedHasChanged The item's selected state has changed. The     value argument is the new selected state (i.e., true or false). Do not     call setSelected() in itemChange() as this notification is delivered. The     return value is ignored.      \value ItemVisibleChange The item's visible state changes. If the item is     presently visible, it will become invisible, and vice verca. The value     argument is the new visible state (i.e., true or false). Do not call     setVisible() in itemChange() as this notification is delivered; instead,     you can return the new visible state from itemChange().      \value ItemVisibleHasChanged The item's visible state has changed. The     value argument is the new visible state (i.e., true or false). Do not call     setVisible() in itemChange() as this notification is delivered. The return     value is ignored.      \value ItemParentChange The item's parent changes. The value argument is     the new parent item (i.e., a QGraphicsItem pointer).  Do not call     setParentItem() in itemChange() as this notification is delivered;     instead, you can return the new parent from itemChange().      \value ItemParentHasChanged The item's parent has changed. The value     argument is the new parent (i.e., a pointer to a QGraphicsItem). Do not     call setParentItem() in itemChange() as this notification is     delivered. The return value is ignored.      \value ItemChildAddedChange A child is added to this item. The value     argument is the new child item (i.e., a QGraphicsItem pointer). Do not     pass this item to any item's setParentItem() function as this notification     is delivered. The return value is unused; you cannot adjust anything in     this notification. Note that the new child might not be fully constructed     when this notification is sent; calling pure virtual functions on     the child can lead to a crash.      \value ItemChildRemovedChange A child is removed from this item. The value     argument is the child item that is about to be removed (i.e., a     QGraphicsItem pointer). The return value is unused; you cannot adjust     anything in this notification.      \value ItemSceneChange The item is moved to a new scene. This notification is     also sent when the item is added to its initial scene, and when it is removed.     The item's scene() is the old scene (or 0 if the item has not been added to a     scene yet). The value argument is the new scene (i.e., a QGraphicsScene     pointer), or a null pointer if the item is removed from a scene. Do not     override this change by passing this item to QGraphicsScene::addItem() as this     notification is delivered; instead, you can return the new scene from     itemChange(). Use this feature with caution; objecting to a scene change can     quickly lead to unwanted recursion.      \value ItemSceneHasChanged The item's scene has changed. The item's scene() is     the new scene. This notification is also sent when the item is added to its     initial scene, and when it is removed.The value argument is the new scene     (i.e., a pointer to a QGraphicsScene). Do not call setScene() in itemChange()     as this notification is delivered. The return value is ignored.      \value ItemCursorChange The item's cursor changes. The value argument is     the new cursor (i.e., a QCursor). Do not call setCursor() in itemChange()     as this notification is delivered. Instead, you can return a new cursor     from itemChange().      \value ItemCursorHasChanged The item's cursor has changed. The value     argument is the new cursor (i.e., a QCursor). Do not call setCursor() as     this notification is delivered. The return value is ignored.      \value ItemToolTipChange The item's tooltip changes. The value argument is     the new tooltip (i.e., a QToolTip). Do not call setToolTip() in     itemChange() as this notification is delivered. Instead, you can return a     new tooltip from itemChange().      \value ItemToolTipHasChanged The item's tooltip has changed. The value     argument is the new tooltip (i.e., a QToolTip). Do not call setToolTip()     as this notification is delivered. The return value is ignored.      \value ItemFlagsChange The item's flags change. The value argument is the     new flags (i.e., a quint32). Do not call setFlags() in itemChange() as     this notification is delivered. Instead, you can return the new flags from     itemChange().      \value ItemFlagsHaveChanged The item's flags have changed. The value     argument is the new flags (i.e., a quint32). Do not call setFlags() in     itemChange() as this notification is delivered. The return value is     ignored.      \value ItemZValueChange The item's Z-value changes. The value argument is     the new Z-value (i.e., a double). Do not call setZValue() in itemChange()     as this notification is delivered. Instead, you can return a new Z-value     from itemChange().      \value ItemZValueHasChanged The item's Z-value has changed. The value     argument is the new Z-value (i.e., a double). Do not call setZValue() as     this notification is delivered. The return value is ignored.      \value ItemOpacityChange The item's opacity changes. The value argument is     the new opacity (i.e., a double). Do not call setOpacity() in itemChange()     as this notification is delivered. Instead, you can return a new opacity     from itemChange().      \value ItemOpacityHasChanged The item's opacity has changed. The value     argument is the new opacity (i.e., a double). Do not call setOpacity() as     this notification is delivered. The return value is ignored.      \value ItemScenePositionHasChanged The item's scene position has changed.     This notification is sent if the ItemSendsScenePositionChanges flag is     enabled, and after the item's scene position has changed (i.e., the     position or transformation of the item itself or the position or     transformation of any ancestor has changed). The value argument is the     new scene position (the same as scenePos()), and QGraphicsItem ignores     the return value for this notification (i.e., a read-only notification). */

comment|/*!     \enum QGraphicsItem::CacheMode     \since 4.4      This enum describes QGraphicsItem's cache modes. Caching is used to speed     up rendering by allocating and rendering to an off-screen pixel buffer,     which can be reused when the item requires redrawing. For some paint     devices, the cache is stored directly in graphics memory, which makes     rendering very quick.      \value NoCache The default; all item caching is     disabled. QGraphicsItem::paint() is called every time the item needs     redrawing.      \value ItemCoordinateCache Caching is enabled for the item's logical     (local) coordinate system. QGraphicsItem creates an off-screen pixel     buffer with a configurable size / resolution that you can pass to     QGraphicsItem::setCacheMode(). Rendering quality will typically degrade,     depending on the resolution of the cache and the item transformation.  The     first time the item is redrawn, it will render itself into the cache, and     the cache is then reused for every subsequent expose. The cache is also     reused as the item is transformed. To adjust the resolution of the cache,     you can call setCacheMode() again.      \value DeviceCoordinateCache Caching is enabled at the paint device level,     in device coordinates. This mode is for items that can move, but are not     rotated, scaled or sheared. If the item is transformed directly or     indirectly, the cache will be regenerated automatically. Unlike     ItemCoordinateCacheMode, DeviceCoordinateCache always renders at maximum     quality.      \sa QGraphicsItem::setCacheMode() */

comment|/*!     \since 4.4     Sets the item's cache mode to \a mode.      The optional \a logicalCacheSize argument is used only by     ItemCoordinateCache mode, and describes the resolution of the cache     buffer; if \a logicalCacheSize is (100, 100), QGraphicsItem will fit the     item into 100x100 pixels in graphics memory, regardless of the logical     size of the item itself. By default QGraphicsItem uses the size of     boundingRect(). For all other cache modes than ItemCoordinateCache, \a     logicalCacheSize is ignored.      Caching can speed up rendering if your item spends a significant time     redrawing itself. In some cases the cache can also slow down rendering, in     particular when the item spends less time redrawing than QGraphicsItem     spends redrawing from the cache. When enabled, the item's paint() function     will be called only once for each call to update(); for any subsequent     repaint requests, the Graphics View framework will redraw from the     cache. This approach works particularly well with QGLWidget, which stores     all the cache as OpenGL textures.      Be aware that QPixmapCache's cache limit may need to be changed to obtain     optimal performance.      You can read more about the different cache modes in the CacheMode     documentation.      \sa CacheMode, QPixmapCache::setCacheLimit() */

comment|/*!     If \a visible is true, the item is made visible. Otherwise, the item is     made invisible. Invisible items are not painted, nor do they receive any     events. In particular, mouse events pass right through invisible items,     and are delivered to any item that may be behind. Invisible items are also     unselectable, they cannot take input focus, and are not detected by     QGraphicsScene's item location functions.      If an item becomes invisible while grabbing the mouse, (i.e., while it is     receiving mouse events,) it will automatically lose the mouse grab, and     the grab is not regained by making the item visible again; it must receive     a new mouse press to regain the mouse grab.      Similarly, an invisible item cannot have focus, so if the item has focus     when it becomes invisible, it will lose focus, and the focus is not     regained by simply making the item visible again.      If you hide a parent item, all its children will also be hidden. If you     show a parent item, all children will be shown, unless they have been     explicitly hidden (i.e., if you call setVisible(false) on a child, it will     not be reshown even if its parent is hidden, and then shown again).      Items are visible by default; it is unnecessary to call     setVisible() on a new item.      \sa isVisible(), show(), hide() */

comment|/*!     If \a enabled is true, the item is enabled; otherwise, it is disabled.      Disabled items are visible, but they do not receive any events, and cannot     take focus nor be selected. Mouse events are discarded; they are not     propagated unless the item is also invisible, or if it does not accept     mouse events (see acceptedMouseButtons()). A disabled item cannot become the     mouse grabber, and as a result of this, an item loses the grab if it     becomes disabled when grabbing the mouse, just like it loses focus if it     had focus when it was disabled.      Disabled items are traditionally drawn using grayed-out colors (see \l     QPalette::Disabled).      If you disable a parent item, all its children will also be disabled. If     you enable a parent item, all children will be enabled, unless they have     been explicitly disabled (i.e., if you call setEnabled(false) on a child,     it will not be reenabled if its parent is disabled, and then enabled     again).      Items are enabled by default.      \note If you install an event filter, you can still intercept events     before they are delivered to items; this mechanism disregards the item's     enabled state.      \sa isEnabled() */

Hover events are delivered when there is no current mouse grabber     item.  They are sent when the mouse cursor enters an item, when it     moves around inside the item, and when the cursor leaves an     item. Hover events are commonly used to highlight an item when     it's entered, and for tracking the mouse cursor as it hovers over     the item (equivalent to QWidget::mouseTracking).      Parent items receive hover enter events before their children, and     leave events after their children. The parent does not receive a     hover leave event if the cursor enters a child, though; the parent     stays "hovered" until the cursor leaves its area, including its     children's areas.      If a parent item handles child events, it will receive hover move,     drag move, and drop events as the cursor passes through its     children, but it does not receive hover enter and hover leave, nor     drag enter and drag leave events on behalf of its children.      A QGraphicsWidget with window decorations will accept hover events     regardless of the value of acceptHoverEvents().      \sa acceptHoverEvents(), hoverEnterEvent(), hoverMoveEvent(),     hoverLeaveEvent() */

If \a combine is true, then \a matrix is combined with the current matrix;     otherwise, \a matrix \e replaces the current matrix. \a combine is false     by default.      To simplify interation with items using a transformed view, QGraphicsItem     provides mapTo... and mapFrom... functions that can translate between     items' and the scene's coordinates. For example, you can call mapToScene()     to map an item coordiate to a scene coordinate, or mapFromScene() to map     from scene coordinates to item coordinates.      The transformation matrix is combined with the item's rotation(), scale()     and transformations() into a combined transformation that maps the item's     coordinate system to its parent.      \sa transform(), setRotation(), setScale(), setTransformOriginPoint(), {The Graphics View Coordinate System}, {Transformations} */

comment|/*!     \fn virtual QRectF QGraphicsItem::boundingRect() const = 0      This pure virtual function defines the outer bounds of the item as     a rectangle; all painting must be restricted to inside an item's     bounding rect. QGraphicsView uses this to determine whether the     item requires redrawing.      Although the item's shape can be arbitrary, the bounding rect is     always rectangular, and it is unaffected by the items'     transformation.      If you want to change the item's bounding rectangle, you must first call     prepareGeometryChange(). This notifies the scene of the imminent change,     so that it can update its item geometry index; otherwise, the scene will     be unaware of the item's new geometry, and the results are undefined     (typically, rendering artifacts are left within the view).      Reimplement this function to let QGraphicsView determine what     parts of the widget, if any, need to be redrawn.      Note: For shapes that paint an outline / stroke, it is important     to include half the pen width in the bounding rect. It is not     necessary to compensate for antialiasing, though.      Example:      \snippet code/src_gui_graphicsview_qgraphicsitem.cpp 8      \sa boundingRegion(), shape(), contains(), {The Graphics View Coordinate     System}, prepareGeometryChange() */

comment|/*!     Returns the shape of this item as a QPainterPath in local     coordinates. The shape is used for many things, including collision     detection, hit tests, and for the QGraphicsScene::items() functions.      The default implementation calls boundingRect() to return a simple     rectangular shape, but subclasses can reimplement this function to return     a more accurate shape for non-rectangular items. For example, a round item     may choose to return an elliptic shape for better collision detection. For     example:      \snippet code/src_gui_graphicsview_qgraphicsitem.cpp 9      The outline of a shape can vary depending on the width and style of the     pen used when drawing. If you want to include this outline in the item's     shape, you can create a shape from the stroke using QPainterPathStroker.      This function is called by the default implementations of contains() and     collidesWithPath().      \sa boundingRect(), contains(), prepareGeometryChange(), QPainterPathStroker */

The clip path constrains the item's appearance and     interaction (i.e., restricts the area the item can draw within and receive     events for).      You can enable clipping by setting the ItemClipsToShape or     ItemClipsChildrenToShape flags. The item's clip path is calculated by     intersecting all clipping ancestors' shapes. If the item sets     ItemClipsToShape, the final clip is intersected with the item's own shape.      \note Clipping introduces a performance penalty for all items involved;     you should generally avoid using clipping if you can (e.g., if your items     always draw inside boundingRect() or shape() boundaries, clipping is not     necessary).      \sa isClipped(), shape(), setFlags() */

The \a mode is applied to \a other, and the resulting shape or     bounding rectangle is then compared to this item's shape. The     default value for \a mode is Qt::IntersectsItemShape; \a other     collides with this item if it either intersects, contains, or is     contained by this item's shape (see Qt::ItemSelectionMode for     details).      The default implementation is based on shape intersection, and it calls     shape() on both items. Because the complexity of arbitrary shape-shape     intersection grows with an order of magnitude when the shapes are complex,     this operation can be noticably time consuming. You have the option of     reimplementing this function in a subclass of QGraphicsItem to provide a     custom algorithm. This allows you to make use of natural constraints in     the shapes of your own items, in order to improve the performance of the     collision detection. For instance, two untransformed perfectly circular     items' collision can be determined very efficiently by comparing their     positions and radii.      Keep in mind that when reimplementing this function and calling shape() or     boundingRect() on \a other, the returned coordinates must be mapped to     this item's coordinate system before any intersection can take place.      \sa contains(), shape() */

If you pass an     identity QTransform as a parameter, this function will return a local     coordinate region.      The bounding region describes a coarse outline of the item's visual     contents. Although it's expensive to calculate, it's also more precise     than boundingRect(), and it can help to avoid unnecessary repainting when     an item is updated. This is particularly efficient for thin items (e.g.,     lines or simple polygons). You can tune the granularity for the bounding     region by calling setBoundingRegionGranularity(). The default granularity     is 0; in which the item's bounding region is the same as its bounding     rect.      \a itemToDeviceTransform is the transformation from item coordinates to     device coordinates. If you want this function to return a QRegion in scene     coordinates, you can pass sceneTransform() as an argument.      \sa boundingRegionGranularity() */

The granularity is used by boundingRegion() to calculate how fine the     bounding region of the item should be.

The lowest possible granularity is     0. The value of \a granularity describes the ratio between device     resolution and the resolution of the bounding region (e.g., a value of     0.25 will provide a region where each chunk corresponds to 4x4 device     units / pixels).      \sa boundingRegionGranularity() */

Reimplement this function in a QGraphicsItem subclass to provide the     item's painting implementation, using \a painter. The \a option parameter     provides style options for the item, such as its state, exposed area and     its level-of-detail hints. The \a widget argument is optional. If     provided, it points to the widget that is being painted on; otherwise, it     is 0. For cached painting, \a widget is always 0.      \snippet code/src_gui_graphicsview_qgraphicsitem.cpp 10      The painter's pen is 0-width by default, and its pen is initialized to the     QPalette::Text brush from the paint device's palette. The brush is     initialized to QPalette::Window.      Make sure to constrain all painting inside the boundaries of     boundingRect() to avoid rendering artifacts (as QGraphicsView does not     clip the painter for you). In particular, when QPainter renders the     outline of a shape using an assigned QPen, half of the outline will be     drawn outside, and half inside, the shape you're rendering (e.g., with a     pen width of 2 units, you must draw outlines 1 unit inside     boundingRect()). QGraphicsItem does not support use of cosmetic pens with     a non-zero width.      All painting is done in local coordinates.      \sa setCacheMode(), QPen::width(), {Item Coordinates}, ItemUsesExtendedStyleOption */

comment|/*!     \since 4.4     Scrolls the contents of \a rect by \a dx, \a dy. If \a rect is a null rect     (the default), the item's bounding rect is scrolled.      Scrolling provides a fast alternative to simply redrawing when the     contents of the item (or parts of the item) are shifted vertically or     horizontally. Depending on the current transformation and the capabilities     of the paint device (i.e., the viewport), this operation may consist of     simply moving pixels from one location to another using memmove(). In most     cases this is faster than rerendering the entire area.      After scrolling, the item will issue an update for the newly exposed     areas. If scrolling is not supported (e.g., you are rendering to an OpenGL     viewport, which does not benefit from scroll optimizations), this function     is equivalent to calling update(\a rect).      \b{Note:} Scrolling is only supported when QGraphicsItem::ItemCoordinateCache     is enabled; in all other cases calling this function is equivalent to calling     update(\a rect). If you for sure know that the item is opaque and not overlapped     by other items, you can map the \a rect to viewport coordinates and scroll the     viewport.      \snippet code/src_gui_graphicsview_qgraphicsitem.cpp 19      \sa boundingRect() */

Drag move events are generated as the     cursor moves around inside the item's area. Most often you will not need     to reimplement this function; it is used to indicate that only parts of     the item can accept drops.      Calling QEvent::ignore() or QEvent::accept() on \a event toggles whether     or not the item will accept drops at the position from the event. By     default, \a event is accepted, indicating that the item allows drops at     the specified position.      Items do not receive drag and drop events by default; to enable this     feature, call \c setAcceptDrops(true).      The default implementation does nothing.      \sa dropEvent(), dragEnterEvent(), dragLeaveEvent() */

comment|/*!     This event handler, for event \a event, can be reimplemented to     receive mouse press events for this item. Mouse press events are     only delivered to items that accept the mouse button that is     pressed. By default, an item accepts all mouse buttons, but you     can change this by calling setAcceptedMouseButtons().      The mouse press event decides which item should become the mouse     grabber (see QGraphicsScene::mouseGrabberItem()). If you do not     reimplement this function, the press event will propagate to any     topmost item beneath this item, and no other mouse events will be     delivered to this item.      If you do reimplement this function, \a event will by default be     accepted (see QEvent::accept()), and this item is then the mouse     grabber. This allows the item to receive future move, release and     doubleclick events. If you call QEvent::ignore() on \a event, this     item will lose the mouse grab, and \a event will propagate to any     topmost item beneath. No further mouse events will be delivered to     this item unless a new mouse press event is received.      The default implementation handles basic item interaction, such as     selection and moving. If you want to keep the base implementation     when reimplementing this function, call     QGraphicsItem::mousePressEvent() in your reimplementation.      The event is \l{QEvent::ignore()}d for items that are neither     \l{QGraphicsItem::ItemIsMovable}{movable} nor     \l{QGraphicsItem::ItemIsSelectable}{selectable}.      \sa mouseMoveEvent(), mouseReleaseEvent(),     mouseDoubleClickEvent(), sceneEvent() */

comment|/*!     This event handler, for event \a event, can be reimplemented to     receive mouse doubleclick events for this item.      When doubleclicking an item, the item will first receive a mouse     press event, followed by a release event (i.e., a click), then a     doubleclick event, and finally a release event.      Calling QEvent::ignore() or QEvent::accept() on \a event has no     effect.      The default implementation calls mousePressEvent(). If you want to     keep the base implementation when reimplementing this function,     call QGraphicsItem::mouseDoubleClickEvent() in your     reimplementation.      Note that an item will not receive double click events if it is     neither \l {QGraphicsItem::ItemIsSelectable}{selectable} nor     \l{QGraphicsItem::ItemIsMovable}{movable} (single mouse clicks are     ignored in this case, and that stops the generation of double     clicks).      \sa mousePressEvent(), mouseMoveEvent(), mouseReleaseEvent(), sceneEvent() */

comment|/*!     \class QGraphicsObject     \brief The QGraphicsObject class provides a base class for all graphics items that     require signals, slots and properties.     \since 4.6     \ingroup graphicsview-api     \inmodule QtWidgets      The class extends a QGraphicsItem with QObject's signal/slot and property mechanisms.     It maps many of QGraphicsItem's basic setters and getters to properties and adds notification     signals for many of them.      \section1 Parents and Children      Each graphics object can be constructed with a parent item. This ensures that the     item will be destroyed when its parent item is destroyed. Although QGraphicsObject     inherits from both QObject and QGraphicsItem, you should use the functions provided     by QGraphicsItem, \e not QObject, to manage the relationships between parent and     child items.      The relationships between items can be explored using the parentItem() and childItems()     functions. In the hierarchy of items in a scene, the parentObject() and parentWidget()     functions are the equivalent of the QWidget::parent() and QWidget::parentWidget()     functions for QWidget subclasses.      \sa QGraphicsWidget */

The line() function     returns the current line. By default the line is black with a     width of 0, but you can change this by calling setPen().      \image graphicsview-lineitem.png      QGraphicsLineItem uses the line and the pen width to provide a reasonable     implementation of boundingRect(), shape(), and contains(). The paint()     function draws the line using the item's associated pen.      \sa QGraphicsPathItem, QGraphicsRectItem, QGraphicsEllipseItem,     QGraphicsTextItem, QGraphicsPolygonItem, QGraphicsPixmapItem,     {Graphics View Framework} */

comment|/*!     \class QGraphicsPixmapItem     \brief The QGraphicsPixmapItem class provides a pixmap item that you can add to     a QGraphicsScene.     \since 4.2     \ingroup graphicsview-api     \inmodule QtWidgets      To set the item's pixmap, pass a QPixmap to QGraphicsPixmapItem's     constructor, or call the setPixmap() function. The pixmap()     function returns the current pixmap.      QGraphicsPixmapItem uses pixmap's optional alpha mask to provide a     reasonable implementation of boundingRect(), shape(), and contains().      \image graphicsview-pixmapitem.png      The pixmap is drawn at the item's (0, 0) coordinate, as returned by     offset(). You can change the drawing offset by calling setOffset().      You can set the pixmap's transformation mode by calling     setTransformationMode(). By default, Qt::FastTransformation is used, which     provides fast, non-smooth scaling. Qt::SmoothTransformation enables     QPainter::SmoothPixmapTransform on the painter, and the quality depends on     the platform and viewport. The result is usually not as good as calling     QPixmap::scale() directly. Call transformationMode() to get the current     transformation mode for the item.      \sa QGraphicsPathItem, QGraphicsRectItem, QGraphicsEllipseItem,     QGraphicsTextItem, QGraphicsPolygonItem, QGraphicsLineItem,     {Graphics View Framework} */

comment|/*!     \enum QGraphicsPixmapItem::ShapeMode      This enum describes how QGraphicsPixmapItem calculates its shape and     opaque area.      The default value is MaskShape.      \value MaskShape The shape is determined by calling QPixmap::mask().     This shape includes only the opaque pixels of the pixmap.     Because the shape is more complex, however, it can be slower than the other modes,     and uses more memory.      \value BoundingRectShape The shape is determined by tracing the outline of     the pixmap. This is the fastest shape mode, but it does not take into account     any transparent areas on the pixmap.      \value HeuristicMaskShape The shape is determine by calling     QPixmap::createHeuristicMask().  The performance and memory consumption     is similar to MaskShape. */

QGraphicsTextItem uses the text's formatted size and the associated font     to provide a reasonable implementation of boundingRect(), shape(),     and contains(). You can set the font by calling setFont().      It is possible to make the item editable by setting the Qt::TextEditorInteraction flag     using setTextInteractionFlags().      The item's preferred text width can be set using setTextWidth() and obtained     using textWidth().      \note In order to align HTML text in the center, the item's text width must be set.      \image graphicsview-textitem.png      \note QGraphicsTextItem accepts \l{QGraphicsItem::acceptHoverEvents()}{hover events}           by default.

comment|/*!     \class QGraphicsSimpleTextItem     \brief The QGraphicsSimpleTextItem class provides a simple text path item     that you can add to a QGraphicsScene.     \since 4.2     \ingroup graphicsview-api     \inmodule QtWidgets      To set the item's text, you can either pass a QString to     QGraphicsSimpleTextItem's constructor, or call setText() to change the     text later. To set the text fill color, call setBrush().      The simple text item can have both a fill and an outline; setBrush() will     set the text fill (i.e., text color), and setPen() sets the pen that will     be used to draw the text outline. (The latter can be slow, especially for     complex pens, and items with long text content.) If all you want is to     draw a simple line of text, you should call setBrush() only, and leave the     pen unset; QGraphicsSimpleTextItem's pen is by default Qt::NoPen.      QGraphicsSimpleTextItem uses the text's formatted size and the associated     font to provide a reasonable implementation of boundingRect(), shape(),     and contains(). You can set the font by calling setFont().      QGraphicsSimpleText does not display rich text; instead, you can use     QGraphicsTextItem, which provides full text control capabilities.      \image graphicsview-simpletextitem.png      \sa QGraphicsTextItem, QGraphicsPathItem, QGraphicsRectItem,     QGraphicsEllipseItem, QGraphicsPixmapItem, QGraphicsPolygonItem,     QGraphicsLineItem, {Graphics View Framework} */

comment|/*!     \class QGraphicsItemGroup     \brief The QGraphicsItemGroup class provides a container that treats     a group of items as a single item.     \since 4.2     \ingroup graphicsview-api     \inmodule QtWidgets      A QGraphicsItemGroup is a special type of compound item that     treats itself and all its children as one item (i.e., all events     and geometries for all children are merged together). It's common     to use item groups in presentation tools, when the user wants to     group several smaller items into one big item in order to simplify     moving and copying of items.      If all you want is to store items inside other items, you can use     any QGraphicsItem directly by passing a suitable parent to     setParentItem().      The boundingRect() function of QGraphicsItemGroup returns the     bounding rectangle of all items in the item group.     QGraphicsItemGroup ignores the ItemIgnoresTransformations flag on     its children (i.e., with respect to the geometry of the group     item, the children are treated as if they were transformable).      There are two ways to construct an item group. The easiest and     most common approach is to pass a list of items (e.g., all     selected items) to QGraphicsScene::createItemGroup(), which     returns a new QGraphicsItemGroup item. The other approach is to     manually construct a QGraphicsItemGroup item, add it to the scene     calling QGraphicsScene::addItem(), and then add items to the group     manually, one at a time by calling addToGroup(). To dismantle     ("ungroup") an item group, you can either call     QGraphicsScene::destroyItemGroup(), or you can manually remove all     items from the group by calling removeFromGroup().      \snippet code/src_gui_graphicsview_qgraphicsitem.cpp 17      The operation of adding and removing items preserves the items'     scene-relative position and transformation, as opposed to calling     setParentItem(), where only the child item's parent-relative     position and transformation are kept.      The addtoGroup() function reparents the target item to this item     group, keeping the item's position and transformation intact     relative to the scene. Visually, this means that items added via     addToGroup() will remain completely unchanged as a result of this     operation, regardless of the item or the group's current position     or transformation; although the item's position and matrix are     likely to change.      The removeFromGroup() function has similar semantics to     setParentItem(); it reparents the item to the parent item of the     item group. As with addToGroup(), the item's scene-relative     position and transformation remain intact.      \sa QGraphicsItem, {Graphics View Framework} */
