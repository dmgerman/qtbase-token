Qt provides support for integration with OpenVG implementations on
platforms with appropriate hardware acceleration.

These examples demonstrate the basic techniques used to take advantage of
OpenVG in Qt applications.  In particular, the "star" example shows how
to mix QPainter and OpenVG calls in the same paint event.


Documentation for these examples can be found via the Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
